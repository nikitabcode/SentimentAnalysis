        "# BERTopic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis - Reviews\n",
        "\n",
        "For the BERT-based sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis and data visualizations were used to understand the emotions expressed in reviews. Sentiment analysis is the process of understanding emotions, opinions, and subjectivity in text (Pang and Lee, 2008). We used a DistilBERT-based sentiment classification model (Sanh et al., 2019) to process large amounts of lexical data and capture the meaning behind words to understand how people feel about a topic. For a better analysis, separate word clouds were created to highlight common words in positive and negative sentiments. By using both text-based and visual methods, the research uncovered patterns in emotions and common themes in user opinions. The analysis helped understand customer feedback better and provided insights into how people express their emotions in digital spaces.\n",

        "The topic modeling revealed important insights into the audience discussions on 'Black Mirror' and 'Love, Death & Robots'. Topic 0 focused on general reviews of its episodes and visual styles. Topic 1 explored Black Mirror's commentary on technology and society. Topic 2 covered neutral and general views. Topic 3 showcased positive feedback on animation shorts. Topic 4's focal point was artistic elements of the 'Jibaro' episode of 'Love, Death & Robots'. Topic 5 discussed Metalhead's heavy metal influences and Topic 6  drew attention to ratings and female characters. The majority of reviews were bundled as 'uncategorised content' under Topic -1. Further, sentiment analysis's results were predominantly positive (65.5%) for the subject matter. The word cloud showed frequent use of words like \"good\", \"love\", and \"great\" indicating a positive response from the audience. Disapproval towards the show was frequent (34.5%), \"bad\" and \"boring\" were the dominant words in the negative  set of word clouds. This sentiment distribution suggested an overall favorable reception with room for improvement addressed by negative feedback. World clouds provided visual context to these sentiments, aiding understanding of key drivers behind audience opinions. Analyzing audience sentiment and topics was important to understand viewer preferences, helping content creators refine storytelling strategies and improve future productions.\n"

[{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"if you remember the 2012 anthology show, metal hurlant, that show did poorly what this show does well. love, death, and robots has some relatively fun story ideas as long as you can tolerate a truckload of gratuitous violence, exploitative sexuality and writing generally aimed at delinquent minded male adults (or kids whose parents don't know or don't care what their kids are watching). it has a lot of similarities to the adult sf comic book magazine heavy metal, so a fair number of stories contain nude women on display, sexual humor, and when anybody gets killed in this show, which is about every five seconds, it is generally in a violently bloody fashion. oh, and if you have ever wondered how many times a show can drop the \\\"f\\\" bomb, well get ready...despite juvenile fixations, there are some cool concept ideas and themes, with solid action and good cg production. these are shorts though, so don't expect any developed depth. each episode is like a snippet of an idea. but effective for what they are. many episodes don't have time to do anything more than carry themselves more on gratuity and visual creativity than real plot, but they successfully hook you in with decent premises, and then ride out an extended scene of the initial idea. for the comic book shop crowd, this is sure to be a winner. ok, so there are some episodes that are quite creative and\\u002for humorous, with occasional twilight zone or star trek type of twists, and these are usually the most fulfilling episodes, but that only happens here and there. three minutes into most of these stories and you pretty much know what you are getting, but this isn't necessarily bad. i would put most episodes on the same level as a typical video game level premise with added adult content. so... sort of a dumbed down black mirror with a superficial video game-ish spin, directed toward the \\\"we never grew up\\\" generation of nerd-core adults.\",\"it is amazing, everyone should watch it. but actually san junipero was the best thing i ve ever seen.heaven is a place on earth indeed!\\nxx\",\"what an amazing collection of short stories.some should be whole series, some videos games, some movies.each & everyone will keep you watching, no less.this is hands down, amazing.animation, storytelling, just sit back for the ride.i promise you won't regret.\",\"i freaking love this. every episode is unique in its own way. i have to admit that i did not like every episode, but overall it was an amazing experience. noticed alot of hate comments... saying about the nudity and the violence, thats a form of art aswell we live in the 21st century there is nothing wrong with those kind of things. there was alot of creativity and plot twists, cant wait for another season. 9\\u002f10\",\"this is exceptionally clever, unique stories with some flawless animations couldn't leave my couch once i hit the play button ,don't have any words to praise the last episode.\\nkudos to netflix and everyone associated with it.\",\"i have to say, it's easy for me to like something, but to blow me away, that's something else. this show, i binged watched when i was on my trip to spain, and i remember thinking about this constantly throughout the whole trip. i couldn't even focus watching a flamenco show in seville because i was thinking about the first episode of this show. this show is a masterpiece, and it takes a lot of intelligence from someone to make this kind of masterpiece. i have to say though, i couldn't finish san junipero because it was such a cliche. but the other episodes were amazing. even if i don't like san junipero, i can admire the work put behind it. therefore i can proudly say i have never been even close to disappointed with this show.\",\"the series is overall good but their is no proper ending of it... the conclusion of the episode is not clear. it feels like incomplete.\",\"well, the idea behind this is great! i enjoyed the show a lot and i can recommend it to anyone.\",\"as with most things in life, to each their own. nonetheless i felt a bit compelled to provide a slightly different point of view from the stream of 10's i'm seeing on imdb so far.i see a lot of \\\"now this is art!\\\" comments. to be clear, film (even when shown on television) has been recognized as art for generations now. granted, this particular series is generally well executed and presents visuals that are often stunning and unique - but let's not trip over ourselves trying to hold up love, death & robots as some breakthrough for the medium. and as gorgeous as it is, it's not without some really obvious flaws. the uncanny valley is still very deep with this series.in terms of substance, this was nothing short of painful to watch. completely predictable plot, utterly shallow dialogue, heavy handed cliches and extremely clumsy in its execution. the \\\"twists\\\" could be seen a mile away, and then any subsequent counter-twist felt tacked on as \\\"gotchas\\\" even though they were often transparent themselves. and the jokes suffered the exact same fate. everything about the script felt like a first draft attempt.there was also a strangely tone-deaf nature to much of the subject matter as well. the series sets up strong themes of empowerment, diversity and responsibility, only to explore those themes through extremely childish, macho narrative devices and stereotypes. it's an adolescent boy's attempt at writing about deeper issues without any greater understanding of them. highly (and needlessly) sexualized (women only), brutally violent (because violence = power of course), and unimaginatively crass and crude (because curse words are \\\"brutal, and \\\"real\\\"). i've seen some reviews actually decrying the themes as \\\"sjw\\\" - but interestingly, i think if you look even a tiny bit below the surface, it's more likely the opposite.yes, i've never seen anything quite like love, death & robots before, but i still find it empty all the same. plenty to see, nothing to take away.\",\"this makes up for the crap so far. was an absolutely awesome series. not even close to what i expected. i thought it couldn't get any better that the yogurt episode but by golly it did and then some. netflix needs to build on this and make it a franchise. who wrote this stuff? if was mind blowing, original and will be very difficult to better. but send us some more anyway. i loved the afghanistan episode. wow, just wow.\",\"this is absolutely one of the best tv series i've been watching for years.too bad that each season is surprisingly short on number of episodes.great work! and also great acting, overall.a must see!\",\"there's not much to say about this show other than its a really unique masterpiece, showing the decay of society covered by pretended smile and ignorance. how even morale persons under the influence of rotten society rules go on the dark path of egoism. the incredible accuracy of how people with different characters will behave in certain situation is what stands out most in this series. stand alone episodes about the consequences and the power of technology. quite possibly situations that will happen in the future. the acting in this show is superb!i highly recommend it to people who enjoy understanding todays society and are worried of the direction this world is taking. and the acting in this show is superb!\",\"beautiful, animation and the whole concept is amazing. you don't even have to watch all of the episodes but i truly recommend it!\",\"there isn't a single quality aspect that hasn't been covered here, from plot details to colour palettes.\",\"it's a masterpiece. i can't even. i just finished watching and am overwhelmed. it looks amazing, stories are deep and exciting, art and animation are ridiculously good and diverse and you can see more character definition and development in 5 min than other 2 hrs movies can handle. for god's sake i cannot believe i just randomly clicked on this when was bored. there is so much raw energy, creativity and madness in this show. i absolutely friggin love it and grateful to whoever did this.\",\"this show is the most interesting series i have come across. black mirror presents scenarios which seem like a natural progression for the trends in the world, and also for potential trends which our society is already gravitating toward, in a way that shows you the benefits but focuses more on the potential negatives which seem to elude us. i applaud the foresight of the writers who present these issues in a way that seems obvious while were watching each episode but probably have not pondered in our every day lives. this show overall seems to have the underlying message that we want all these things which we believe will better out lives but comes with a set of problems which ultimately doesn't change anything. i believe this show is meant to help us appreciate the simpler things in life or at the very least challenge the wants we believe are the most important. either way, a very interesting show and i would recommend everyone to watch it.\",\"this was the best animation i seen in long time it was super great yull fall in love with it just like i have cant wait for season 3.\",\"this series caught my thought and displayed it on international media.\",\"the sci-fi tv series starting with a horrendously disturbing episode yet turning out to be a minimalistic accent tv series is such a likable one which is indeed unique in itself. every episode is not interrelated to each other and each episode till date is up to the mark to be called a black mirror episode. the characters is really intense and have been appealing enough to leave a mark despite having around an hour of screen time. the stories are well written, and the direction is par excellence. not to forget the cinematography, it never fails to attract, yet is a bit not equally good in a few episodes. the solo one hour episode with no relation to any background story nor requiring an explanation ultimately immersing the viewer in the story makes this show stand aside.this show has indeed been one of my favorites and every episode has portrayed the sad yet actual face of our society which how in future could turn out to be a nightmare. this series also shows the beautiful impact of trchtechno on human lives, how it being crucial can some day turn out to be a bizzare spoilt mistake. this series in literal metaphorical term, is a mindbender.\",\"they really need to make the first episode feature length. the series gets a 7 from me just based on that, the other stories are interesting, some better than others but there's something for everyone.\",\"pretty good overall!! some episodes are just mind blowing & amazing!! love it!\",\"a collection of animated short stories that provides various genres including science fiction, fantasy, horror , crime and comedy. in order to comparing the first season and the second one , i should say the first season was beyond imagination but second one was not as good as first one . the subjects are not related and you can watch the episodes not in a row .\",\"the account of thought they put in this is amazing.\",\"it sucks! gone are the true pk dick stories we all love, to be replaced by mindless stupidity- extremely disappointed!\",\"this series is definitely worth it watching! 10\\u002f10\",\"brilliant.absolutely brilliant.this is not anti-utopian, it is an actual mirror of a utopian idea gone terribly wrong.i've only watched 3 episodes so far and each one has made me think, made me go back and look again, made me ask myself why this had never occurred to me before.i would call this sci-fi in the richest sense of the genre.... it is not about science, but how science affects human beings. the one thing that never seems to change is us. technology evolves, mutates, advances and declines, but human beings, our feelings, our courage, fears, and desires remain within us.i love this show. i hope you will love it too. and i hope you will think.\",\"just watch it, and your will understand this is a true masterpiece.finally a legendary show\",\"i have to say i've never given a 10\\u002f10 rating before, but this merits it.\\npure genius! definitely has a black mirror vibe which can never be a bad thing.\\neach episode stands alone in its brilliancy.\\ncan't wait for more.......... well done to all involved in making this masterpiece!\",\"i liked the first season of love death + robots, and the second season is just as interesting and enjoyable. the mix of animation styles is impressive, as are the plots of the various episodes. one thing that is obvious is that cgi is getting so good at photorealistic creations. it is getting more and more difficult to differentiate between cgi created human images and real people. some people probably find that very unsettling, including a lot of actors who could eventually get less work. technological advances are taking their toll on a lot of professions and jobs. i look forward to a third season of love death + robots.\",\"after some episodes, which was just stupid, i planned to rate it with 1 star. but when i increase engagement , i found that it was not so bad what i thought in previous. so rated it with an average. liked it. all the best to the director.\",\"i've never written any reviews before to start with. but this anthology right here is just something. the script, the animation, the gore. everyone is just so well done. netflix is really setting their own standards for their original shows.\",\"this is a british sci-fi anthology television series. it takes classic series like twilight zone into the modern world. one of the interesting aspect is that it's a british show. back then during streaming infancy, the show was an unknown across the pond. one had to hunt for it. it has the ability to shock but it's also british which made it a little like masterpiece theatre. it pushes at the envelope of what it means to be tv. it makes you think. it entertains. it's discussion worthy. it is the best of the genre.\",\"wonderful heart touching short stories, each one can explain how that the human being is the wildest animal on the earth\",\"i discovered this netflix original tv series a bit late. i only knew of its existence when i watched the promo for the second season on netflix's youtube channel.i could not put down the remote just like i did when i watched the first four seasons of game of thrones years ago. i binge watched both seasons in a weekend. every individual story in this animated science fiction anthology could be made into a full 2 hour movie and i would gladly pay to watch all of them.the hyper-realism of many of the animations is out of this world. in some of the stories you really have to watch the facial expressions carefully to know this isn't live action, but animation. i got goosebumps with some of the stories. the stories are crazy good too. i honestly felt a lot of joy watching this series and i wish the makers of these short stories make full featured sci-fi films for the mature audience someday. seriously, the kids have disney and their subsidiaries companies like pixar. but i would love this kind of hyper-realistic animation made for the adults with adult themes. i see the potential for the producers to make a lot of money. and because its animation, the creativity should be unlimited.i rarely give out 10\\u002f10, but this series deserves it. i was so hooked i was disappointed season 2 only had 8 episodes when season 1 spoiled me with 18.\",\"every episode is outstanding, from the varying visuals to original storylines. it's heavy metal meets black mirror. working off the genius of twilight zone and outer limits. the perfect series for our generation.\",\"some of the episodes are simply fantastic. some of them are just... not. it's up to the people behind each episode. the people writing, acting, producing all change every episode. that's awesome. it means that you get fresh ideas and are able to enjoy a wide range of amazingly creative people. unfortunately, there are a few combinations that just aren't as good.on the whole: fantastic. each part: roll of the dice.\",\"this tv series has very good writing, good directing and the animation is very stunning. it's also very funny and sad at times and can really change your mood when watching all the episodes. my only problem with the series is that there is a lot of unnecessary nudity scenes, it gets uncomfortable at some points. other then that you should watch this series if your bored. it will make you not bored.\",\"this show..this show, what kept me away for so long from watching this show. thank you charlie brooker for the best show of all time.black mirror is a television series that originally aired on e4 for it's first two series until it was bought by netflix, and has received a much more bigger audience since its removal. if i had to say, i do believe the show was a tiny bit better then when it was on e4, but i mean a tiny bit better, i am not saying the show got worse, but you can tell it got way more involved with the us, but still kept to it's original british roots. the series takes place in either the same universe or 19 different universes, which would make more sense as the show is very hard to piece together as a related universe show, and follows different futures where technology slowly begins to outsmarts man, in good ways and bad ways (by good ways i mean san junipero and that's it). i am literally in love with the show, as it practically shows us how one day, technology is gonna roar over humankind and probably destory us, if it's physically or mentally. some of the stories have already frickin happened (nosedive, be right back, national anthem). the show has no bad episodes, although some do feel very poorer to others, but still send powerful messages. if there was a episode to send a silly message, it would have had to been metalhead (even though i still love the episode and remain in my top 10 favourites) or playtest or men against fire, which were my two least favorite episodes out of the entire show. my favourite episodes have to be fifteen million merits, nosedive and san junipero, darkest episodes would have to be shut up and dance, crocodile and white bear, while least favourites would have to be men against fire and playtest.well, black mirror is officially my new favorite show now, sorry american horror story!\",\"one of the best dark comedies. must watch show.... would make you think how we are losing yourself...all episodes with different story line.. commendable work ...\",\"it is probably my favorite series of all time. what a fkn masterpiece. haven't watched everything cuz there are literally 18 episodes of this madness. couldn't recommend it enough. just watch it damn it\",\"so. it started good with episode one. an interesting terms and conditions\\u002fsupercomputer story.after that i'm not even sure what i'm watching. black mirror was good because of the ideas it presented. all episodes did not present any intelligent ideas. e.g the space station episode, why not have the robots on the space station?it's an epic fail for me. i found most of the episodes quite frankly dull and uninteresting.--so. it started good with episode one. an interesting terms and

street very similar feel to the old animatrix series that came out many years ago. each episode is different and the different genres and animation styles are superb but my only gripe is the unnecessary nudity in a few of the episodes. especially when it serves no plot purpose. without the nudity it's a straight 10\\u002f10\",\"in our world were we are surrounded by bs content it is rare to find original ideas. this series delivers impressively lot of it. no episode is genius, but some of them are absolutely great. one gets disappointed when the next episode does not blow your mind and is simply good.but god. what a pain it is when youve seen enough for the day and try to watch light content instead. you open youtube, are confronted with 2 stupid ads, skip through a stupid video and end up on stupid yt shorts. all of them had one in common. they tried to be original. maybe this is why they failed.i do not think the producers black mirror primarily thought about how to entertain the audience. the inspiration for the episodes comes from problems we phase currently or fear in the future to deal with. we admire black mirror because it mirrors our reality (at least the dark parts). made up content has flaws. nothing fits. to many contradictions. but a series based on reality - it wont face these plot holes. and this is what makes many of these episodes so great. they are potential realities.anyways. i think black mirror might change the way you think. and if this is the first time you check that kind of genre out - this change might be major.\",\"if you loved the animatrix series of short films, you will love this new collection of 18 dystopian future stories centering around technology. different artists and styles for each story just like animatrix.\",\"i got curious because of enthusiastic reviews, but was let down eventually. i must admit i only watched the first 6 episodes or so, and may be two others, during which i caught myself fast forwarding. i will not continue.there really was not a single bit of originality here. every sci-fi and film noir fan will get the feeling of having seen every plot multiple times before. this also regards the atmosphere, which there is not much of in the first place, as there is too much action and most of the animation looks sterile, often akin to a video game. the only thing unique or new here might be the concept of an anthology.if i want violence, i can play a video game. if i want nudity, i can watch porn. both is generally over-stimulating, but might be required for the digital generation to feel anything at all. a small dosage can contribute to the plot or to the atmosphere, but when it becomes a cause of its own it turns voyeuristic.and trying to be \\\"edgy\\\" means being a try-hard. it's just pretentious. an \\\"edge\\\" is nothing but a gimmick, a mask to hide the emptiness behind it. always.i had some good laughs during \\\"three robots\\\", which is a bit calmer and more of a sketch. three robots strive a post-apocalyptic city. nevertheless, there still was too much of a moralistic vibe of \\\"humans destroy themselves\\\", which contradicts the incredibly humanoid nature the robots themselves show and which is heart of the story (heck, they're tourists). this left a bitter aftertaste.another calmer episode, \\\"when the yogurt took over\\\", was plain silly, not funny, just blatantly boring.\\\"beyond the aquila rift\\\" was an alright attempt at creating an abyssal and nightmarish sci-fi vision, which i usually adore, but again i got this intense feeling of déjà vu here.you could rather spend your time watching some classic 80s and 90s sci-fi. blade runner, akira, alien, neon genesis evangelion, ...i guess the genre is dead.\",\"honestly. what can i say that has not been said here already? i have never been so thoroughly amazed.. enthralled... just... the animation was so beautifully done! just wow. my mouth fell open so many times! i have re-watched quite a few of the episodes. absolute shear magnificence! please please please keep this series going!\",\"wow, wow, and wow!! these stories are amazing! i am not typically into animated stuff but figured i'd watch an episode because they're so short. now i can't stop watching. each one is brilliant. of course, some i like more than others (lucky 13 & three robots), but all of them have caused a strong reaction or emotional response. like with helping hand i had to watch through my fingers. that was intense, made all the more so because of how good the animation was. at times i wondered if it really was animation.\\nso if you're like me and not too into animation, just give one or two episodes a try, i bet you'll be pleasantly surprised.\",\"cleverly put together by making good use of the horror that modern technology and social media can be. just like the old twilight zone series of the 80s, this series give the same creepiness and mystery.\",\"one of the most captivating aspects of \\\"black mirror\\\" is its ability to capture the essence of contemporary concerns and fears about the rapid advancement of technology. the show isn't afraid to explore uncomfortable and sometimes disturbing scenarios, forcing viewers to confront the potential consequences of our digital age. it's a modern-day twilight zone that challenges us to question the ethical, moral, and social implications of our technological choices.the writing in \\\"black mirror\\\" is exceptionally sharp and thought-provoking. each episode is a meticulously crafted narrative, often with unexpected twists that leave the audience pondering long after the credits roll. the series effortlessly balances suspense, drama, and even dark humor, creating a truly immersive experience.furthermore, the acting in \\\"black mirror\\\" is consistently top-notch. the show features a rotating cast of talented actors who bring their characters to life with depth and authenticity. whether it's a heart-wrenching portrayal of a parent's grief or a chilling depiction of the dangers of artificial intelligence, the performances are consistently compelling and believable.what truly sets \\\"black mirror\\\" apart is its ability to resonate on a personal and societal level. the stories might take place in futuristic settings, but they tap into universal themes of love, fear, power, and the human condition. the series prompts us to question our own reliance on technology and its potential impact on our lives.in a media landscape saturated with generic content, \\\"black mirror\\\" stands out as a shining example of innovative storytelling. its thought-provoking narratives, exceptional acting, and social commentary make it a must-watch for anyone seeking intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant entertainment. whether you're a fan of science fiction or simply interested in exploring the complexities of human existence, \\\"black mirror\\\" offers a captivating journey into the uncharted territories of our digital world.\",\"let's be honest, anyone who has read a bit of science fiction could guess the plot of most of the episodes less than 2 minutes in.you can also see it's been produced for netflix, as the show really pushes the independent quirky dystopian character trope and the idea that everything men do is ruin (women's) lives and the environment (sonnie's edge, 3 robots, good hunting, the dump).\\nthat and some unnecessary sex\\u002fnudity that sometimes fell flat.on the subject of animation, there's good and there's bad.\\nthe art directions are nice, sometimes reminding me of lastman, sometimes it's more like a computing power demo with huge spacial settings in an over-realistic modelling. but there's good diversity even if you sometimes see there's tracing in there (the witness).\\nwandering features (wtf happened with good hunting?), big drops in framerate ... it can feel rushed.that being said, the show manages to take us for a tour of varied small universes that work fine for what they're trying to tell.\\nthe way it's been produced also helps, as we're given many different creative choices.special mention to zima blue, my favourite episode as it's not trying hard for some impressive bs, it's perfect as a 5 minutes story. if the whole season had been just this episode i'd given the show a 9.tldr : baby's first sci-fi, but short enough to be dynamic and not feel pointless.\",\"it's as good or better than any cgi movie out there. is raw as f\",\"i cannot believe this has an 8.5 rating on here this show is complete trash. it tries so hard to be quirky and \\\"out there\\\" but it fails and comes off as stale and stupid. everything in this show i've seen before. the dime a dozen sci fi dystopia, the big fighting robots, the post apocalypse we've seen a million times etc. the yogurt episode is a rip off of the movie the stuff. it's like somebody took all the rejected black mirror scripts tore them up and rearranged them to come up with these episodes.just because a show is animated does not make it good. this show is trendy, boring, predictable and uninspired. i watched season one and i can promise you i will not be watching one nanosecond of season two.\",\"i have to agree on the reviews on here that netflix has made a superior show with great acting story telling and over the top violence. just hope they make a second season thumps up\",\"after having delayed watching this for quite some time, i just didn't think it would be my cup of tea, i finally decided to give it a shot one evening. and i'm really glad i did, because the overall experience is amazing and i definitely recommend it.now notice i said overall experience. that's because, as i mentioned in the title, this is a series of many different flavors. and not all of them are good. goes without saying this is subjective, but the quality really, really varies between each short story. some are straight up 9\\u002f10, while others go as low as 5\\u002f10. my personal favorites are \\\"sonnie's edge\\\", \\\"three robots\\\" and \\\"good hunting\\\". after you watch it you might agree or disagree, that's just the nature of the show.i have to mention the a-list voice acting, though. there are some serious names in the credits and it was a lot of fun to try and recognize each voice and where i might have heard them before.love, death + robots is definitely a breath of fresh air and i hope we see another season at some point in the future.\",\"this is what happens when you stifle creativity with company rules and regulations, targets and data.i knew they were going to play it safer when i read an article after they green lit second seaon , about how they are going to have less nudity and violence to \\\"appease\\\" the masses (the bad ones that won't even watch this probably, ongs and pro that communities and anti that groups).they never ever learn, please let art be art no one is going to use a gun because they used it in a game or saw it in a movie.waited a long time for this, maybe next season ;-\\u003c\",\"\\\"black mirror\\\" is a science fiction series that opens a window and lets us peek into a future that seems to be getting closer and closer.\\n i´m a fan of this show since it started in 2011 and despite its acquisition by netflix in season 3, nothing has been lost in terms of creativity and every episode of this season 4 continues to offer us stories in a future that feels more and more present. by the way, this is the characteristic that i like the most in this show, the future is strangely familiar and plausible, as if what we are seeing can actually happen in an increasingly technological world that still keeps much of what we know today.\\n each episode presents us with a new story with new themes and characters, always maintaining the background that characterizes the series, a future that may be more or less black and dystopic and in which we are confronted with the consequences of the use of technology in the evolution of the society and the human being.\\n there are always many and complex questions that stand at the end of each episode and insist on staying in our thoughts. perhaps because of this, \\\"black mirror\\\" is a reference to the effect of a tv screen or computer that, when off gives a dark reflection of the viewer.\\n my favorite episode continues to be \\\"nosedive\\\" of season 3, which shows a society that lives by the rules of a social network and where the success and happiness of each one is decided by the evaluations given by others (it does remind us of something familiar, does it not? ). \\n this season, the episodes \\\"uss callister\\\" and \\\"hang the dj\\\" are my favorites, the first being a satire to the classic sci-fi shows, full of black humor and that makes us think to what extent virtual clones are conscious beings, and the second a vision of relationships and soul mate search through algorithms of an advanced virtual dating system.thanks netflix for having started the year in the best way and i can only hope that this is just the beginning of a 2018 full of such good quality series.\\ngood - creativity, innovation, black humor, the ability to surprise, reminiscences of \\\"the twilight zone\\\", thinking the future\\nbad - few episodes\\nverdict - excellent, a must see\",\"what is said in the title is the answer to the question if i were asked to briefly describe this collection of short films. from the first there is a penchant for conventionally acute social themes and exaggerated cruelty, and from the second a mixture of genres from science fiction to horror with the obligatory unexpected plot twist at the end.they say that the viewing sequence for different users may differ depending on certain parameters. i personally watched the collection on netflix, i haven't tested this theory, maybe there is something underneath it, although fundamentally it doesn't affect anything. the videos are not connected to the plot in any way.it is worth noting that those who are especially impressionable and suspicious, as well as those who are not fans of modern short films, should immediately pass by most of the videos in the selection, since the level of \\\"anatomical\\\" cruelty, gore and other guts in the frame is relative (and more often without) in each second video subjectively repeats a number of fatalities from the latest parts of \\\"mortal kombat\\\" combined. perhaps the presence of one of the authors of \\\"deadpool\\\" is having an effect here, but it seems that this is the general tendency of the genre today, when it comes to modern short films from england or the usa - maximum bloody action, straightforward eroticism, and a pinch of semantic load.everyone who is not too lazy has already gone over the general points, so to describe in a nutshell i will draw (where i can and i see the point) an analogy from the category if you liked it, then you can pay attention to the following in movies, games, less often somewhere else along the next gradation :+ - subjectively liked it.+\\u002f- \\\"watchable.\\\"\\n? - strange.* nothing particularly interesting.(!) - an additional designation for the \\\"relatively\\\" context of \\\"not moderate\\\" volumes of blood and other \\\"obscenities\\\". in case anyone wants to bypass them.18:(!) + 1. sonnie's edge. cgi graphics. a typical sketch of the cyberpunk genre.* 2. three robots. a parable about eternal human shortcomings and idiosyncrasies in the interpretation of three robots that are not similar to each other. the closest statement on the topic is \\\"wall-e\\\" (2008).(!) ? 3. the witness. again cgi, but with an emphasis on realism. i forgot the name of this technique... i'll leave it without comment. \\\"memento\\\" (2000) by christopher nolan.+\\u002f- 4. suits. no comments. if you're interested in big, walking mechs, then when it comes to games, \\\"mechcommander \\\"(1998-1999) and the \\\"battletech\\\" (2018) are worth a look.(!) - 5. suckers of souls. anime. lots of blood. the semantic load is level with the latest parts of \\\"another world\\\" with kate beckinsale. if you like vampire themes, i recommend the very first part, which was released in 2003. as well as the classic rpg genre - \\\"vampire: the masquerade - bloodlines\\\" (2004). or wait for the sequel.+\\u002f- 6. when the yogurt too... 3d animation. and another philosophical parable. similar to 2.(!) + 7. beyond the aquila rift. cgi in space with a twist at the end. cgi is of a level we probably won't see in games for years to come. but who knows. to play - \\\"mass effect 2\\\" and 3.+ 8. good hunting. not a bad anime with a touch of steampunk and erotica. google \\\"steamgirl\\\". if you're lucky, you'll end up on a site with a clear combination of the first and second.* 9. the dump. 3d. \\\"district no. 9\\\" (2009).(!) - 10. shape shifters. cgi with an emphasis on realism about the heavy burden of werewolves in the war in afghanistan.* 11. helping hand. a parable about self-sacrifice. \\\"moon 2112\\\" (2009).? 12. fish night. graphic style: \\\"cel-shading\\\". see the entire \\\"borderlands\\\" series from gearbox.+\\u002f- 13. lucky 13. again space and battles in it. a parable about superstitions.+ 14. zima blue. an abstract meditative creation about the search for the meaning of life. \\\"exit through the gift shop\\\" (2010).+\\u002f- 15. blindspot. an ordinary outing of \\\"shadow runners\\\" in a typical cyberpunk. see the \\\"shadowrun\\\" trilogy of games.+\\u002f- 16. ice age. the only video with real actors + cgi. i'll leave it without any other comments.* 17. alternative histories. a \\\"what if?\\\" story. the drawing style is somewhat reminiscent of modern 2d flat, used here and there. specifically in the context of the plot - the trilogy of \\\"wolfenstein\\\" games, starting with \\\"the new order\\\", \\\"the man in the high castle\\\".(!) * 18. the secret war. cgi + mysticism. play \\\"singularity\\\" (2010).as for the rating, minus two points for the degree that is clearly on average too bent with the component of the formula according to the principle \\\"sea of blood and mountains of corpses\\\" == cool!. not cool.and another minus point for the combination of this matter with the often lack of semantic load as an element as a whole. the pretentiousness of some conventionally art-house authors is annoying. in contrast, one way or another, we have already seen all of this to one degree or another in different, sometimes better, packaging. so, i got 4 out of 18 full pluses: \\\"sonnie's edge\\\", \\\"beyond the aquila rift\\\", \\\"good hunting\\\", \\\"zima blue\\\".\",\"nsfw has never been this good. with stories that contain different themes that will appeal to different people, this is one netflix show that you don't want to miss.\",\"this show is groundbreaking in a way that graduates nerd passions to a new level of awesomeness. netflix is clearly not scared to tap into textures, storylines and out of the box formulas that redefine excellence in production. bravo to netflix who seems destined to be leader in a new kind of vision.. i feel like a 10 year old kid that just discovered the shock and awe of lord vader. awesome...\",\"some of the best episodes in the show are less rated than episodes that are more easy to understand !\",\"this is maybe the top of cgi tech, but the most of the episodes are not memorable. the stories are quite repetitive, i have seen tons of sex and nudity, heard tons of f words, and seen blood more than love,death and robots, honestly put in the stories often without a reason. a missed masterpiece,what a pity. i preferred the underrated oat studios, much more story in that.\",\"there are good tv shows, great tv shows and then there is black mirror. i knew nothing about the show before getting into it and i am not a fan of horror, so i was skipping this every time it appeared on my netflix watch-list, especially as it was giving the creepy vibes. but, how wrong was i!! this even remotely does not belong to the horror-genre.. i clicked play on netflix and the first episode i ever watched was uss calister (netflix decided to automatically play the most recent season first even though i did not watch previous episodes!!), but a glad mistake, i was spellbound by the end of the it. it was everything for the \\\"nerd\\\" in me times 100!! there was cool tech, the mother, gripping story-line and homage to star trek, i was soo pleased by the end of it that i wanted to watch it again! then i read about the series and found of that the show was an anthology, mainly created by itv and purchased by netflix after they noted its brilliance. my binge-watching marathon commenced, right from the first episode of season one (you can watch it in any order, but if you want to see the evolution of a relatively low budget series into a netflix extravaganza, i would recommend watching in the order which the show intended to) the first episode with the uk prime minister and the pig was bizarre to say the least, still with brilliant writing but the second and third episodes were one of the best things i ever watched. season 2 started with an amazing, heart-touching episode and then ends with a bang in the form of \\\"white christmas\\\". this episode was screen-writing at its best and provides a very convincing\\u002fshocking premonition of what future tech will evolve into!season 3 and this is where you can see how netflix millions manifest onto small screens. brilliant episodes, one after the other and it is soo satisfying to binge-watch them! season 4 continues the same theme of excellent episodes and ends with a bang in the form of \\\"metal head\\\" and \\\"black museum\\\"!! i wish netflix announces season 5 soon as i simply cannot get enough of black mirror!! do yourself a favour and do not miss this master-piece at any cost. it really is \\\"worth\\\" the netflix subscription!my fave episode in chronological

season was already episode 2, but we get 2 amazing ones here ...\\nnosedive: like, comment, share, thumbs-up .. what if your entire life was based on that!! brilliant episode giving us a peak at the impact of social acceptance. ...\\nsan junipero: this should go down in the history as one of the best love stories. ...\\nmen against fire: soldiers at war with very new high-tech vision, both sad

sea of thoughts and awe!!!\",\"can't really write much because i don't think i could do this show justice. acting great. directing is great. writing is great. because it always a different show every

the worst episodes.for black mirror in full display, watch white bear, 15 million merits or san junipero.for an overdose: watch white christmas, three bm stories in one.oh, well, watch all of them. you won't regret it.\",\"ok, i'm watching this series up to season 3 so far and i gotta say, why is there so much hate? i read so many hate comments saying how it tries to emulate twilight zone and it's not even as good as the reboot from 2002 so what if it's not as good as twilight zone? it is still a good series, with episodes that are like mini movies with a good plot or a twist that makes them so enjoyable. sure the first episode was a complete mess, but the rest of the episodes actually are entertaining to watch, with stories you can actually get a message from it's not the best series out there, but it's certainly far from being the worst just because \\\"it's not like twilight zone\\\" (which hardcore fans don't even liked the reboot) my advice, watch the series if you like thrillers or sci-fi movies, only that these last an hour or less\",\"the reaction to this show has been exceptional in botht ht epositive and negative. i am more surprised with the negative reaction than i thought possible since it surprises me. people seem to take issue with the gratuitous nudity or the protrayal of violence in association with women in this series which makes me wonder if i watched the same series as the critics. i didn't see any victims in this show, i saw survivors and strong women being portrayed in ways that were very creative. beyond my issues with the critics i think this show is phenomenal. how it portrayed a dystopian future or advanced technology and civilization in ways i haven't seen in a very long time is remarkable. the only negative thing i could say about this show is that the episode ice age was definitely the weakest and i wonder if it could have been better without the flesh and blood human actors portrayed on screen. if you are on the fence about this show let me help you decide, go watch it now, watch it with an open mind and no preconception, and above all just have fun watching it.\",\"i am not sure if it was pc or the fact that it got popular and the executives thought they would make it mainstream for profit but this season ruined the show for me, and i will not be looking forward to the next season in the same way.\",\"i tried my best to watch all the short episodes back to back in one set as they were short (\\u003c 20 minutes\\u002feach) but still i couldn't as the ideas presented are scattered and alot of them were not new to me. from all the 18 episodes i watched from season 1, only fewer than 6 episodes were intellectually smart scripted (beside the eye catching visuals) and lot of sci-fi fans would appreciate them.. the rest were fun to watch but they were not interesting that much.the episodes were like a playlist with the title \\\"love, death & robots\\\" of short movies that are different in content but they fall in the titled category.the episodes do not hold back on violence, gore, and nudity.. which make me feel that episodes are not concentrating on the ideas but on \\\"showing\\\" what they think the audience want to see.. a lot of episodes i thought of skipping but i didn't just to give a fair chance for the review.\",\"i was leary at first, the stories did a great job of pulling you in and keeping you inthrawled with each episode.\",\"black mirror - season 3 - episode 1 - white christmas is by far the craziest audiovisual trip in a long time. a twist most likely to those times of master david lynch himself. i mean i see here influences from so many films, tv series, but put those influences all together in one episode is a riddle of not so many. to what levels do you let your mind go? is that enough to write about it? is that good to film it? do you think people will pay for that? what do you wanna show? what do you want them to know? do you think you can handle the story out? right from the beginning? well, think again... black mirror makes you wonder. wonder more. black mirror is a blend of crucial elements in order to lift off from your mind, your most intense stimulus and feeling. it is unbelievable wise - outrageous\",\"if you want to feel even more anxious about life, the future and especially technology, by all means, watch this.i personally found it beyond depressing, and absurd.\",\"thanks god for such brilliant works that created by talented miller and fincher.\\nmost of them are really amazing and everybody should watch them and judge them for

gifts the viewer with the element of surprise, not only in terms of subject, but through the unfolding of the unique plot as well. a trait very rare in today's ocean of diluted series, whom often do not have the intellectual ability to achieve total unpredictability as well keep the viewer enslaved to their screens (ironically) from start to finish. while i selfishly would love for more episodes to a season, i understand that this is what will doom the show. black mirror is, indeed, a case of quality over quantity with its ingenious concepts and authentic story lines.\",\"like a lot of people i think we've gotten to a point where anything that is new we just hope is the next best series. i really enjoyed a number of the episodes from season 1, particularly sonnie's edge, the witness, and good hunting! but season 2 i felt was a major let down both for the fact they cut the episode count by half, and also i really only enjoyed one of the episodes they did put out. i have let my subscription go for the past six months or so because the quality control they have on series like this has slipped and i have lost interest. a total shame, i really think that adult animation is a very untapped market- i really would like more shows of this style rather than the rick & morty or american dad types.\",\"initially, the series consists of 18 episodes that will pass with you very

mirror-\\nblack mirror, each episode tells a different story, thoughtfully made by different directors. black mirror is available on netflix with every episode showing different stories. not a single episode is related to one another. this show particularly talks about the advancement in technology we will have in the coming years and how it will affect each individual in different ways.what makes this show which is available on netflix so different from other shows is the way it portrays the stories with such details. all the actors did a great job and each story seems very new, exciting and engaging.after watching the whole series one can get an idea that this show's beauty lies in its remarkable ability to speculate on the potential future of our technologically driven world. for example, one of its episodes shows the use of artificial bees by govt. to spy on people and how it is even good for the environment. by the end of this episode, the system gets hacked, people are targeted and killed by the bees etc. viewers should be warned that the series does not shy away from exploring disturbing themes such as murder, crime, and suicide. very few of the episodes show happy ending and each story seems to be open ended.the compelling narrative of each episode is further elevated by powerful performances from the cast, adding depth to their characters and stories. every element of the show - from the direction to the performances, and even the music - seamlessly comes together to create a truly unforgettable viewing experiencethis netflix series keeps viewers wanting to watch more from start to finish. and by looking at the current developments in the technology, it really makes you believe in the gadgets used in the show. each episode is phenomenal in its own way. the direction, performance, music everything is just amazing. all these things give this show a special touch which one cannot ignore. the episodes show us both the amazing and dangerous sides of playing with technology.while the show often ends on a somber note, it never fails to captivate the audience. it's disturbing yet thought-provoking themes make us reflect on the trajectory of our current technological advancements. in the end, \\\"black mirror\\\" is not just a tv show. it's a thrilling and sometimes scary look at our world, showing us where we are now and where we might be going. this netflix series is truly a one-of-a-kind experience that keeps viewers hooked from beginning to end.\",\"? does everything have to be right?\\n? why good people shouldn't die?\\n? what

not often i say this but this really is must see television.\\nif you can't get in to it then i don't know how to help you.\\ndon't just watch one episode. they are all so different that you really have to watch 3 or 4 before making up your mind.\",\"lots of impressive animation and gratuitous sex and violence. the only bad thing i have to say is that the first short was the best short. i enjoyed the rest of them regardless of this.\",\"excellent! it's well written and unexpected. animation is on point and comes in many styles. takes a stab at all genres and comedy and nails it, just spent the whole day watching all episodes and couldn't help but think of how good it is\",\"this collection of animated short stories is definitely some of the best that netflix has produced. there wasn't one that i disliked, though i liked one less than the others and a couple didn't seem to fit, but it's a good anthology series altogether. comprised of short stories, original ideas, and individual animation styles, \\\"love, death & robots\\\" delivers something for everyone and a lot for anyone who loves sci-fi.\",\"this show was set beyond our time, incredibly interesting with ideas on our mind! to see our ideas played out was so interesting to watch.\",\"the show seems to try really hard to be thought provoking and unpredictable but the end result is exactly the opposite. most episodes make their point within the first 10-15min and then they beat it into absurdity which makes the show a chore to watch.i don't understand what the hype is around this show, it's nothing revolutionary and most of the time it just comes across as pretentious, go watch the outer limits, it's much better written and the ending is almost always a surprise.\",\"not even telling you what this shows about. get it watched. if you don't like it you're an idiot. fact!\",\"love, death & robots was originally going to be a feature length reboot of heavy metal; it's pretty damn stupefying knowing the path they ultimately decided to go with: an animated series of self-contained stories on netflix where there are no true restraints on the contents of the stories or visuals. these stories are perfect trips for video game fans, sci-fi fans (like myself) and even comic book fans who just can't get enough of their far-and-wide alternate universes in fiction.netflix is truly raising the bar for mainstream filmmaking, and this series shows that it doesn't conform to nostalgia-driven things like 'stranger things' all the time, but that even in an age where people love familiarity with their stories there is still a desire to see something new, inspiring and insightful. love, death & robots is exactly that kind of ecstasy; it's an experimental trip that's both familiar yet satisfyingly new and bold. i'd say that my favorites would have to be 'alternate histories', 'good hunting', 'sucker of souls' and 'the witness'. to be fair though, all the episodes are pretty good. they each cover their own respective genres just nicely.if you want to check out love, death & robots but haven't gotten around to doing so because you're still yet to make up your mind, do yourself a favor and watch this pronto. it's a netflix-must!this netflix-must gets 4.5\\u002f5 stars.\",\"so entertaining, touching and deep, helps ppl be wiser and hopefully, make better choices . the ideas in each episode are also genius, cinematography also is good. u should watch it\",\"i have never in my life been so emotionally shocked, straight up punched square my very high expectations for moving arts.\\neach one of the episodes is truly magnificent and i would do a disservice to my fellow fans if i didn't try this hard to manifest what i experienced.\\ni really hope they continue the series,\\ni would love that\",\"better than these imdb rated greats: game of thrones (they remove too many of your favorite characters and there are too many episodes where nothing of significance or entertainment happens but for 10 out of 60 of the minutes of the given episode), all the david attenborough nature\\u002fscience documentaries\\n(which are spectacular to say the least), fargo, the office, the dark knight (actually overrated. batman the animated series and batman begins far superior) and many more.i put black mirror on top 25.\",\"i loved this! an anthology of what could happen if science went just a little too far. but how far is too far?\\nevery episode has me thinking \\\"woah!\\\". and this taught me an important lesson: do not connect devices to your brain!\",\"black mirror - netflix's hit sci-fi drama is back with its fourth season. while the first three seasons raised the bar for sci-fi dramas, a lot is expected from the fourth season. will the makers live up to the sky high expectations of their fans? does it get repetitive?\\nfirst off would like to make it clear that we are not on the payroll of netflix or amazon prime video. but when these compete with each other to give us the best content, we can't help but be in awe. like in any other season the latest season consists of a bunch of standalone episodes. some episodes have some familiar faces in terms of tv celebs. each episode speaks about the perils of technology & how adversely it will affect us in the future. the scripts are one of the best we have seen. each episode got us thinking & stayed with us post the show.\\nthe fourth season is similar in execution as compared to the previous season. the episode about the dating app simulation was our favorite. the first episode about an it honcho, who has made his fantasies come true in his own private world sets the tone for the remainder of the series. new viewers will have no difficulty whatsoever following the show. \\nblack mirror is easily one of the most flawless show on netflix. the only hitch is that since there are no recurring characters, it fails to build an emotional connect with its viewers. but you can;t have it all can you? what it lacks in emotional connect, it makes it up in freshness. each episode is diverse from the others.\\nplease do not miss this show for anything under the sun!\",\"love, death & robots is a groundbreaking anthology series that boldly explores the intersections of science fiction, horror, and dark humour through a variety of visually stunning and thematically rich short films. each episode stands alone, offering viewers a unique blend of storytelling styles and animation techniques that push the boundaries of traditional narrative and visual artistry.the show's greatest strength lies in its variety. with each episode crafted by different creators, it presents a kaleidoscope of artistic visions and narrative approaches, ranging from hyper-realistic cgi to experimental, stylised art. this creative freedom results in a captivating array of stories, each exploring profound themes such as the human condition, technological evolution, and the darker aspects of love, death, and robotics. the anthology format ensures that no two episodes feel alike, making every instalment a fresh and unpredictable experience.episodes like beyond the aquila rift and zima blue stand out for their emotional depth and philosophical undertones, showcasing the series' ability to delve into thought-provoking territory. these episodes transcend their animated format, delivering narratives that linger in the mind and invite reflection. in contrast, high-energy episodes like sonnie's edge highlight the series' flair for intense, action-packed storytelling, proving its versatility in both tone and pacing.however, the anthology's diversity is also its achilles' heel. not every episode achieves the same level of impact, and some feel more like visual showcases than fully realised stories. while the inconsistency is a natural byproduct of the format, it can occasionally disrupt the overall experience. despite this, the series' ambition and creativity consistently shine through, offering moments of brilliance that outweigh its weaker entries.visually, love, death & robots is nothing short of spectacular. its cutting-edge animation and innovative designs set a new standard for the medium, making it a feast for the eyes as well as the mind. the freedom given to the creators ensures that the visuals are as varied and daring as the narratives, further enhancing the series' appeal.in conclusion, love, death & robots earns its place as a standout in the world of animated anthologies. its bold storytelling, stunning animation, and exploration of provocative themes make it a unique and exhilarating viewing experience. while some episodes may fall short, the series as a whole offers an unforgettable journey through the imaginative and the extraordinary, proving that animation can be as profound and boundary-pushing as any live-action medium.\",\"love, death & robots makes a clear statment once again that time only encapsulates what it can show.with how each of the episode is formatted, some of the episodes have 8-15 minutes to express themselves. that is what makes ld&r great, due to the small time frame, it crams in its theme right up to the core of its stories.now, its up to the audience to try an comprehend the purpose of the episodes, whether it is clear or unclear. this shows just keeps people coming back for more once you're hooked!by far my favorite is from ss3 episode 2, \\\"bad traveling\\\", its able to pull off a cinematic and thrilling story worth over an hour of content within 15 minutes.\",\"this show is one of the best tv shows that i have ever seen it's soo realistic great directing great actors grreeaattt writing\",\"all episodes of the first four seasons were something to remember and they all had some kind of message. the last season must be a joke, it cannot taken seriously.\\nno message, no deep layer, nothing to think. just a thin story with a happy end.\\nit's more like a disney movie.\",\"most people would agree that love, death & robots is a mixed bag, only no one will agree on the mix. someone online wrote a ranked listicle that put the amazingly animated the witness dead last, which lead people in the comments to create their own radically different lists, none of which i agreed with.i've seen about half of season one, and most episodes have been good-to-great. my favorite is easily the very funny three robots. i also thought the witness and yogurt were terrific and quite enjoyed some of the others.but like everyone else, my list would be unique to me. so far my least favorite episode is easily beyond the aquila rift, which is half softcore cartoon sex and half set up for a predictable twist, but it's got the highest imdb user rating of the whole season.so watch an episode. if you don't like it, watch another. sooner or later you'll find something you like, and wind up writing your own list that no one agrees with.\",\"i watched this baked asf and it was insane! such a trip!\",\"a showcase of various talents within the sci-fi writing and animation world. a superbly varied selection of short quirky stories displaying a huge range of animation and writing styles. love , hate , hope , comedy and horror it's all here. there's something for everyone. let's hope there'll be more seasons. anything that celebrates new animation talent deserves our full support and admiration.\",\"love, death & robots has given us many striking stories, but none reach the poetic, philosophical heights of zima blue. this episode transcends animation, becoming a deeply human meditation on purpose, identity, and the search for meaning.the way it unfolds, peeling back the layers of the artist's journey, is nothing short of poetic perfection. that line-\\\"un-making myself... leaving just enough to appreciate my surroundings...\\\"-hits like an existential gut punch. it's so pure, so deeply human.each moment adds depth to the story, culminating in a realization that touches on the profound beauty of simplicity and the origins of one's existence.it's story about the essence of life itself. zima blue reminds us that even in a world of endless complexity, there is profound beauty in simplicity and a sense of purpose in knowing who we truly are.it's one of those rare stories where the ending lingers in your mind like an echo, refusing to let go.hats off.\",\"trust me, you will watch this show in one day! its so good.\",\"my adore series caus it takes all ideas will happen in our near future and make it in black image\",\"an anthology sci-fi, of sorts, should be refreshing and welcome news in this era of the fetishised serialisation of anything that moves but this show kinda nose dives after the opening few episodes of season one. the animation is variable, sometimes very basic and the stories often don't have any sort of payoff. there's a non sequitur feeling to proceedings despite the heightened drama although i did enjoy the recurring vacationing droids. mostly the stories have the sci-fi archetypes and a sci-fi feel but without sci-fi stories to go with them. i feel these would do the job for film school course work but quite why the show got so much attention is another baffler from the streaming age.\",\"created in 2011 by charlie brooker, it's a series who includes a different types like horror, sci-fi, thriller and drama.\\nit's an english series. this one talks about the impact of the new technology in our life.each episodes are independent. there is no order between them.\\nfor example, the episode \\\"nosedive\\\" the most realistic in the series, show a fictive world where everybody gives a rating using their phones.\\ni like this episode because it seems crazy to live in this world, to depend of the rating for the work, activities, earn apartment ...\\nif you have a bad rating, you can't do this things.\\nbryce dallas howard who's playing the main characters gives a fantastic performance.\\nconcerning the realization of this part, the director wants to show us a perfect world with a catchy music and pastels colors.however, \\\"hang the dj\\\" is less interesting than the others, because it seems too long and too confuse. the plot talks about only a date between two persons.\\nthe ending of this part doesn't come across convincing.in conclusion, i really recommend this series because there is a twist on every episodes. that's what makes this series unique.\\nit will change the way you see the new technology.\\nit's a must on netflix, don't miss it!!!!\",\"if you watch this whole series...you can see the reality of it...and it's horrifying. i believe that this series really makes you think about how easily and fast things can get out of control. it was an awesome show!\",\"a show that is shocking, emotional, disturbing, and entertaining at the same time. some episodes may go a bit too far for some teenagers, so they may not be ready yet. adults should be fine watching it if they are okay with shocking films.\",\"the twists, the turns, the comedy, the emotion, the horror. it's all put together so wonderfully. every episode leaves you wanting more.

from this brilliant acting directing music etc.well done guys!keep on rocking!\",\"i have always seen black mirror as presenting a near possible implication of the everyday technology as it is evolving. it presented the peak into the future how our lives with evolve with the technology. season 6 is although very disappointing after such a long wait. first episode has the signature style of black mirror and was a wonderful example of gen ai combined with hyper personalization.however the rest of the episodes feel like some sci-fi out of 1980s mixed with psychological drama. esp the one with the tapes in the episode 2 that is so not black mirror material. neither the spaceship and the jealous co pilot.\",\"i can't stress how good this series is. from the very first episode it just hooks you. every episode is different which is brilliant. you will never get bored. this series makes you assess the world around you. a lot of what is depicted is happening now and you can imagine some of the other stories coming true eventually. i have seen all the episodes including 2018 and i just hope they will continue to make more.\",\"i was so impressed that it made me come here half way through the episodes and just give it a 10\\u002f10. i had heard nothing about it and simply decided to check it out, turned out to be unexpetedly good! interesting stories, mature unapologetic themes, amazing animation styles, humorous at times! you never know what to expect from the next episode. just watch it and enjoy\",\"a very disappointing season. the success of the series is based on intelligent thought provoking episodes that usually have a twist at the end. with the new sudden technological advances such as agi and ar i thought there would be new interesting episodes based on that. the only episode that fit this criteria was beyond the sea.the mazey day episode i watched second and nearly gave up watching the rest. a 12 year old could have written that twist at the end and has been done to death. completely unoriginal and childish, what's the point. another episode had a demon. why!?a demon and a werewolf!?\",\"love death and robots is one of my favorite shows on netflix. the varying animation styles and intriguing stories just tie it together to be a very appealing collection of short films. i feel like i'm watching a books with meaning full stories and interesting plots.\",\"you'll never get the same thing twice and will be gripped to the edge of your seat. you won't know how to feel until the credits roll and i love every roller coaster of emotion.\",\"well, i have to admit, i've swallowed it, alright... but when i've got through those two seasons, i felt something odd - why do i have the feeling that this artsy, independently presented thing seems to have a hell of a budget for the special effects department, and why do 90% of the episodes ramble about tv shows or the likes ? hm. and then i watched the credits - what a surprise !!! pure, black mirrory irony: the producer of this show is endemol - pretty much the production company worldwide who entertains or should i say renders people completely stupid in front of their tv set with exactly the type of shows criticized along the black mirror episodes. wow. now you can call me paranoid or a conspiracy addict, but that seems like a perfect marketing strategy to me: depict those shows, which would eventually come up next, a little irony here, a bit of voyeurism there, see which one pays off in the audience and the forums and here we go for the next-gen batch of stupid game and reality shows. i must say, the best scenario definitely goes to endemol's think tank. bravo.\",\"wow this exactly what i want! a series that raises important subjects in our society and for our future!every plotwists is fantastic!one of the best series out there, that makes you wanna watch the episode directly after one of another!the episodes enlighten questions that is modern for our

its a mixed and innovative genre that fits many people.manuscript and music is very well made!i recommend this very strongly!\",\"poorly written bs, extremely misagonystic, no point in the meaningless short stories that are not short enough, lots of fake reviews and ratings on imdb, totally disappointing!\",\"it never ceases to amaze me how many people exist out there that you can spoon feed garbage to and they will come back and tell you it tasted like delicious ice cream. this appears to be one of those very same situations.i watched the first 2 all the way through and tried to watch 6 more beyond that, but was unable to complete them. some of them had very good animation going on, others not so much. they all had terrible writing, dialogue and voice acting in common however.if adults came up with this, then they are not masters of their craft. they either don't have a talent for writing, or they need to get a lot more life experience under their belt before they should be given a platform like this to show off their work.every show i watched was loaded with extremely predictable scenes and plots, very bad dialogue, and very frequent clichés. most of them tried very hard to be artistic, but it all felt so forced. as such, it failed to deliver any real entertainment value to me.most people are giving this pile of garbage a ten star rating... ten stars!! y'all realize that means this is one of the best things you've ever seen in your life! that's like saying sesame seeds are the greatest snack you've ever had. it just doesn't make sense.... and.. it's an abuse of the rating system that imdb was kind enough to provide you. i bet most of you gave aquaman 10 stars as well. the celebration of mediocrity continues... sadly...\",\"its great, it has something for everyone.my favs are white christmas and shut up and dance so far.we need more shows like this. as every story is different, so u don't get bored.\",\"this series is exactly what you expect from a series titled 'love, death & robots' made by netflix.stories are variable in quality, but hey...i enjoyed them all.as for the 'critics' comment asbout sexualising women etc....show me any game and marvel film that doesn't....even black panther does a good job of this (that critics have picked for an oscar...hmm).anyway, on to the series....\\nthe animation is excellent. variable and fantastic. when each episode starts, i think 'oh i'm not sure about this animation style'...within 30secs, i'm thinking 'i cant see any other animation style working for this episode'.every other aspect is good...better than most films released currently, comparatively.\",\"love, death, and robots (s02, 8 eps, 10+ mins, netflix) returns for a significantly shortened - thanks covid19 - season. my review doesn't really vary from season one's. the story's are too short, much like a scene or two from a larger film or what used to be called \\\"pilot\\\" episodes of proposed new series. in any case, the focus of effort\\u002fbudget for each is the animation which is mostly photo realistic with extraordinary detail evident at times. concentrate on this instead of the very short stories and you'll be much more satisfied.*** season 1 *** ld&r (s01, 18 eps, 10+ mins, netflix) is an anthology of 18 short (10-15min) mostly animated episodes. please pardon me for not reviewing each of them separately. however, they're all top notch quality, not a dog in the bunch. much of the animation that's done is photo-realistic - amazing. only one episode \\\"ice age\\\" uses live actors mixed with sfx. most if not all of these could be launching points for films or series, since they were so short; they seemed more like a scene from a larger effort. do note however that several of the episodes are not suitable for younger ones, but for us adults, they're a real treat.\",\"i have not seen something beautiful ever with nostalgic animation work.thank you netflix for this and all the super creative creators.watched all three seasons and waiting for another season.\",\"this is an anthology show that covers scifi, urban myth and fantasy. each episode covers a unique and different story from one another. the scifi stories in all three seasons were good and intriguing with deep emotions, which suits the title \\\"love, death & robots.\\\" i am not interested in seeing episodes based on urban legend or myth, which contradicts the title. the episodes \\\"zima blue,\\\" \\\"pop squad,\\\" and \\\"bad traveling\\\" were my favorite ones from the show. but still, few episodes were underwhelming and boring, despite the short length of the episode. the uniqueness of animation in each episode was admirable, and it was an addon to create an interest in the art style. the writing was good enough to give quality content in a short time span. the music was good. in conclusion, i loved this show. i would recommend everyone to watch this show.\",\"i think everyone should see these brilliant episodes.\",\"don't read this , infact don't read any reviews. hit the play. this was a fun ride.\",\"i've been a huge fan of the series. until i watched the new season. i had to stop several times for the last seasons because sometimes i got overwhelmed, and this time i did stop but because it was so boring. it's just boring and some episodes like loch henry don't even feel like \\\"black mirror\\\" stuff. super disappointing...\\ni would say joan is awful is easily better than others though. it's like the only black mirror episode you can expect.i think the beauty of the series is that you get to think what the meaning of \\\"black mirror\\\" is. it can be the black screen of your monitor, phones, device, etc. but this season...i don't even know.\",\"the writing in this show is outstanding you can tell they are careful with details and if you re watch a episode you will see the little things the characters say to make sure the story is clear and point in a certain direction and because the writers are so good at turning your head to one part of the story, you realize that everything you knew was about the current plot has changed into a new meaning. i know this sounds weird but the stories are amazing. i binged watched this so much while my relationship was on the edge and my girlfriend left me. but its okay because i sorta feel like this is worth it lol this show needs to be more recognized.\",\"although this show can definitely be corny\\u002fedgy, i think every episode of this show (minus the bear episode) catches my attention and makes me want to keep watching! i think they are enjoyable to watch and they have very nice cinematography as well as well performing actors. with the exception of (the masterpiece that is) san junipero, they are all genuinely creepy to some degree too. my favorite episodes would be fifteen million merits, white bear, san junipero and playtest. the banksy-esque technology themes can seem a little tiresome but not enough so that it affects my interest in the show! i'll keep watching until they stop making them.\",\"yep. sometimes i have to log in, come here to the comments, and put in my two bits just because... a show or movie made me cry. this is one of those times.and even when a particular episode doesn't tug at those particular heartstrings, it winds up tugging at some others. and there's just not enough of that in popular media products, these days.netflix is picking up the old narrative gantlets that traditional media money is now leaving to (otherwise) shrivel up and die on the ground. good on 'em.\",\"i don't have time to watch tv but after watching the first episode, imma have to make time!!!\",\"despite the fact that this kind of animation series are not my cup of tea i found some of them really good. blood, sex, violence and rude language everywhere is the part i enjoyed the most. i'd highlight 'the witness' and 'kill team kill' as my fav. and as the odd one out that didn't fit in here but i liked was the one about yoghurt dictatorial regime in our society.\",\"all the episodes are well written and created... dark and twist, some times hardcore and really dark or

one - the 17th. my own rating of the 17th series is minus 10!\",\"quite simply this show is an example of why it's worth watching television. supremely talented writers with an ever improving budget

every episode multiple times. it's the rarity of a thoroughly enjoyable from a dark comedy and cerebral slice of modern world reflection.\",\"people who were involved in this production\\nshouldn't be

in each chapter, there are different facts and system criticisms that you will learn from. there are some episodes in particular that, if they were published as a movie rather than a series episode, they would easily find a place in the imdb top 100. it seemed unfair to me that they published it as a serial part :) it is one of the rare series that i watch without missing a second of it.\",\"gratuitous overuse of the f-word... if it needs to be used once or twice to establish the makers' bona fides, so be it... by the way, it's not only this show, it's seems as if almost every show or movie... trying to figure out what it proves... who's being marketed to...i'm no prude... i like the big lebowski, speaking of overuse of the f-word...i've overused the word myself on occasion... just getting tired of hearing it...also occasional gratuitous use of violence and nudity.. i guess i could change the channel, but some of the episodes are otherwise interesting enough to ignore my complaints, qualms.each episode also needs a much stronger appropriate-age viewing notice... the little notice up in the corner for about a second is not enough... needs a large notification that takes up the full screen and lasts for 2 to 3 seconds... and specifies what elements got the show its rating: so it is clear that this show-though animated-is for an older audience.otherwise interesting technical work.. most episodes seemed to have a difficult time finding a satisfactory conclusion.\",\"rather a sad collection of highly derivative stories.it has strongly fascistic, pro-war, pro-us imperialism themes.it seems, in many of the stories, to be propping up us exceptionalism.it is basically badly made, very obvious, immoral propaganda.\",\"i thought about watching this series for some time and i'm so happy i finally did, because this is what an anthology series at it's best can be. reminds me a lot of the outer limits, which was one of my favorites back in the 90's.\\nblack mirror is a fascinating way of looking in to the future more or less tongue in cheek. the only reason i'm giving it 9 instead of 10 is that i wish there was more horror elements, but you do get your share of horrible imaginary though. also the first season as a whole is boring compared to the rest of the seasons. (the waldo-episode was a complete snoozefest.)\\nthe acting is really good. i also love the fact that i get to see familiar actors and actresses like bryce dallas howard or got's jerome flynn, which also do an amazing job. the special effects are seamless and i wish more series and movies had such a fantastic effects.\\nmany of the episodes come together from the simple idea that technology and social media are consuming us and our world at a fast pace and it's dooming us more or less. i am not myself a huge friend of social media or the latest gadgets so i agree 100%.\\nyou should most definitely watch this series, it will make your day!\",\"i was blown away by the animation and some of the stories were amazing. such a pity so many of the stories contain propaganda.\",\"netflix, this is what we want more of! not \\\"tidying up with marie kondo\\\". i mean, can it get more dull than that? i know how to clean my house.on to the positives: this came out of left field. i always check at the end of a month what's coming up in the next one on netflix and this was def not on the list i saw, bc it totally would've grabbed my attention immediately had it been. i love anthologies, sci fi, and animation; this checks all those boxes. there really isn't even a bad episode out of 18, all under 20 mins i believe; but there are at least 2-3 stelllar short films in here. all are at least good, most are somewhere between \\\"good\\\" & \\\"stellar\\\". they range from brutal & violent, to dark comedy, to straight up goofy. def nsfw. please netflix, take note of this overwhelmingly positive reaction. make and buy rights to more of this kinda stuff, please!all that being said, there is def some nwo technocratic conditioning and predictive programming going on here, just be aware of that, develop and maintain a sense of symbolic literacy, and it's less likely to permeate into our un\\u002fsub-conscious......edit\\u002fupdate: second season is absolutely abysmal maybe 1 decent episode out of 8....\",\"volume 2:summarythe second volume of this remarkable anthology of animated shorts is on netflix, with its usual variety of themes, genres, characters and situations and its astonishing and varied visual qualitygeneral reviewthe second volume of this anthology series comprises 8 animated short films (with durations ranging from 7 to 18 minutes) that cover, as in volume 1, a wide range of themes, situations, characters and genres: the automation of housework, races in menacing places, eerie breaks on a train journey, amazing santa claus, odyssey in remote places, genetically modified people and cyperpunks, space warriors, robots with inerperated behaviors, monsters, immortal human beings.in terms of genres, dystopian science fiction dominates (some refer to the universe of philip k. dick) but there are some wonderful fantastic stories - one of them lovecraftian - two of which are among the best in the series (the grass alta and the sleeping giant) and others with some touches of black comedy (automated customer service and the visit)in any case, the greatest merit of the anthology continues to be its extraordinary quality and visual variety, with a palette that goes from the comic line (ice) to others of an astonishing hyper-realism (refuge, evolutionary response and the aforementioned the drowned giant), going through other aesthetics closer to the disney universe (automated customer service and the visit), stop motion and something from the visual world of video games.in short, a juicy and varied collection of shorts ideal as an aperitif before watching a movie and not bingeing on them.individual reviews1) automated customer servicea housewife must deal with the unusual setbacks caused by a malfunctioning robot vacuum cleaner.2) icea group of modified teenagers challenge a common one to a race on a dangerous icy surface.3) pop sqad\\na police officer must fulfill a strange task to preserve the immortality conquered by humans.4) snow in the desertsnow is a loner who lives in the desert and is targeted by several bounty hunters for one of his attributes.5) the tall grasswhen a train stops in a place of tall grass, one of its passengers decides to investigate some strange lights that appear in the distance.6) all through the housea bizarre christmas tale about an unexpected visit for two little brothers on christmas eve.7) life hutcha space warrior makes an emergency landing on a planet and when entering a shelter he must face an anomalous situation.8) the drowned gianta naked giant seems stranded on a beach in a coastal town and arouses the curiosity of its inhabitants.2) volume 2summary:tim miller and david fincher's new collection of animated shorts once again displays a wide variety of graphic styles (2d, 3d, cgi), tones and genres. terror, horror, violence, action, science fiction, fantasy, humor and poetry come together in what is perhaps the best season of the series and, without a doubt, the most mature.review:\\nthis volume is made up of nine shorts, whose durations range from 7 to 23 minutes\\nhere are some comments on each.1) the 3 robots: exit strategies\\nit continues the minisaga of these acids three robots already seen in the previous volumes. here they tour a post-apocalyptic world and deliver sharp commentary on how the ruling classes faced the end of the world and tried to survive. the style is 3d and realistic, with great attention to detail.2) bad travelling\\nit is a terrifying marine tale, the most ambitious in the series, directed by david fincher, about a shark fishing vessel invaded by a monster with whom the crew must come to an agreement, which triggers a game of alliances and betrayals. hyper-realistic, sinister, dark and with an overwhelming display of gore, it is one of the best shorts of the three seasons.3) the very pulse of the machine\\namazing survival odyssey of an astronaut on io, one of jupiter's satellites. with a very comical 2d aesthetic, it offers us an absolutely lysergic science fiction experience, with hypnotic colors and a wonderful soundtrack. poetic, metaphysical and absolutely moving, it is also one of the highlights of the series.4) night of the mini dead\\ndizzying short film about zombies that begin to devastate different cities on earth. the novelty lies in the \\\"distant\\\" point of view and the way in which it shows its settings, combining artifice with violence and humor very effectively. he spares no darts against the us and the insignificance of humans.5) kill team kill\\nsweeping short about a us squad in afghanistan who must rescue a hostage from a cave. with comic aesthetics, ultraviolent, abundant gore, heavy metal and biotronic animals on stage, mocking the codes of this type of story.6) swarm\\na scientist visits an extraterrestrial biosystem called the swarm to extract useful information from it for humans. the place has a kind of human hostess who serves as a guide. with a 3d aesthetic that is somewhat reminiscent of avatar, both characters move through an environment between aquatic and weightless through one of the most fascinating settings in the series, where science fiction, love and horror come together.7) mason´s rats\\nhumor returns in this story about a farmer who hires various increasingly sophisticated and violent devices to confront a plague of intelligent rats in his barn, with whom he engages in a pitched battle.8) in vaulted halls entombed\\nonce again a squad must rescue a hostage. but in this case it is a short film with an incredibly hyper-realistic aesthetic thanks to the use of cgi. the characters access an unsuspected ancestral setting of a net lovecraftian stamp, bloody, colossal and dark.9) jibaro\\nwe are facing another of the summits of the entire series. a group of expeditionaries -reminiscent of the spanish conquerors due to their armor- faces a kind of aquatic nymph or undine. greed and the possibility of love with one of them in a hyper-realistic short with an amazing use of cgi, but with a choppy and very original way of narrating. a poetic, tragic, sad and captivating story in lush settings and a great soundtrack.\",\"i sat and refreshed netflix until 3:30am waiting for this to come out earlier this morning. since i'm a night person i was able to start this and didn't stop watching until i saw every episode at like 7am.this was so good. some of the animation was so amazing i had to google to make sure it was all animated as some of the segments could actually be mistaken as real actors. short of one segment with topher grace, it is all animated. every single episode of this was original and incredibly well done, hopefully this gets enough support to warrant a season two.if you like adult animation at all, or science fiction... or even fantasy there will definitely be a lot here for you to like. i honestly have no complaints, there was nothing about it i didn't like, thus the perfect 10 star review. i hardly ever rate shows unless they are exceptionally great or exceptionally bad, luckily this falls in the first category.\",\"if you like to watch 50 mins long movie ideas that are scrapped and denied by higher ups, enjoy.it's not that the quality is low. no it isn't. it's just not high on visuals or story or the dialogs.\",\"medley of sci-fi short stories stands outs primarily thanks to its variety: in tone, in mood, in duration, in genre, in animation. indeed love, death & robots entrance you by the fact that you don't know what to expect. love story in nickelodeon style animation? cgi action full of gore? abstract painting philosophical thriller? animation on its own worths sincere praise: quality of the picture is astounding, as well as style. to be honest, i didn't even know that computer graphic progressed so far. characters from, for example, sonnie's edge or beyond the aquila rift feels very very real.unfortunately, diversity is the only bright side of the show. there are 18 episodes and only 1 of them (good hunting) brings novelty to the table, story-wise. of the remaining 17 half is bluntly bad and the other half is built upon some cliche foundation. yes, i liked this other half because i like to watch these deep spaces horrors, machine-turn-human-ballads, cyberpunk worlds, cosmonaut survivals, robots-explore-human-culture comedies, etc. but the fact is that such stories are totally unoriginal as even i, amateur viewer, have seen them all before, and not even once. i agree, that maybe it was artistic intent to convey the mood sci-fi circles by bringing to viewer the most earnest stories, the stories where we can feel the soul of the author, his passion. but soul and passion is present in any fanfic work and, well, it is what the stories of love, death & robots are - fanfics.\",\"wonderful idea , wonderful job and a wonderful show, i loved it .. seriously everyone should watch that 😍😍\",\"this somewhat reminds me of the animatrix, though none of the stories are interconnected. if you are a sci-fi fan, then you will easily binge-watch this season (hopefully more are to come). my favorite is three robots, because my wife brought two cats into our marriage and she bought me the game \\\"exploding kittens\\\". you will have to watch the episode to fully understand, but it is very funny.\",\"forget what people say and watch it the first episode is the worst but still acceptable but the second and the third is incredible\",\"finnaly an original animation series for adults. so original so brilliant i can't stop watching it. the short episodes keep me so engagded. i just want more and more. please deliver more content like this.\",\"prepare to see a real, very unique masterpiece in last episode. all are quite decent but last one is just something else. incredibly well done from story, visuals, music, audio effects and all atmosphere altogether. work of art brought to perfection in animation world. i keep re-watching it like 10 times already and still love it!\",\"this has been a truly adventurous journey of 6 seasons. each of them unique giving us taste of horror, comedy, dark comedy, wild, politics, suspense and most importantly ai and technological advancement.i have been watching black mirror from a long time and i can surely say that i have watched some amazing episodes leaving me stunned and apeechless most of the times.if you are bored to watch series which include too many episodes to finally come to an end then 'black mirror' is a perfect thing for you to enjoy. the only thing about this is that not everyone can watch this and no one will be able to enjoy all the episodes, especially the last 2 episodes of season 6, which fell totally irrelevant, weak or dull than all previous episodes or season. but leaving aside those episodes you will surely love this black mirror's idea of a single story for a single episode.\",\"the first episode had me hooked! was like watching an amazing story line in a game! i wish there was a movie done on it, that's how much i loved it! animation is incredible, on episode two and i am laughing my head off. hitting each genre perfectly. 100% recommend!\",\"the best seasons of the show are long in the past. seasons 2 - 4 when it was still pretty much british were the amongst the most compelling, interesting, shocking and thought provoking. then season 5 happened and it's been going downhill ever since with less and less quality. i hope season 7 is its last so bm can maintain some dignity as it goes out rather than going down the got last season complete mess.season 1 - 6 stars : a good start if you can get past episode 1.season 2, 3, 4 - 9 stars : very few misses here! this is penultimate bm.season 5 - 3 stars : what the hell!?season 6 - 5 stars : middling and only one real standout episode.\",\"i have only watched 3 episodes but the first one just made me glued to it. the story telling in just 18 mins is incredible. i wish episode 1 was a full series in its own. did not think this was what the series was about when i just clicked on it to see what it was. reminds me of the abcs of death but less creppy and messed up and more about the story telling. if you love games and sci fi then this is for you\",\"the twilight zone based in technology rather than sci fi.that's basically the best way to describe this amazing show. it can be dark, it can be heavy, but more often than not it's very compelling and worth watching.i will say, since this is an anthology, that some episodes will be very different than others. due to a person's personal taste their favorite\\u002fnot so favorite episodes may vary dramatically. one of my personal favorites is the second episode, fifteen million merits, yet often times i've seen it in the lower half of people's lists...and that's ok. each episode will speak to someone in a different way. it's part of the fun.as long as you can handle thoughtful stories that don't always have a happy ending, you won't be disappointed by this series.\",\"this series is a work of art. you may find some of the series boring, but at the end there is such wisdom that you will not find anywhere except \\\"black mirror\\\". best: black museum, hated in the nation, uss calister, bandersnatch, smithereens (yes, 100% reality), the entire history of you, white christmas. very real: joan is awful, mazy day (how the media works and happiness because of someone else's tragedy), nosedive (already exists in china. probably elsewhere). dangerous modern technologies that are slowly becoming a part of our lives. in this series, you will see people who could be any of us - how many give up their principles and lose their selves in exchange for benefits.\",\"lots of these are interesting\\u002faction packed, not all of them are great, especially the comedy ones... if you plan to look for comedy the best one is three robots, being the most visually appealing along with good humor. the main problem is all of these have twists, which some of these are predictable such as mirror's edge(although that wasn't a bad short) and some of these make you feel like they deserve a spin off series which i believe was what netflix was planning to do if they weren't all concluded, shooting a few ideas in the dark and see if they hit seems logical, if not they do have a season 2 in plan so maybe the following episodes would be transitioned there, all of the shorts are animated differently and feel different from each other(besides its dark nature)\",\"if you want to eat popcorn in your couch and watch something predictable where the bad guys are killed mercilessly by some agency one more time, wait for the decaf american remake, it could be even starred by tom cruise, of course, to add depth to the storyline, you know.but if you're after something fresh, thought-provoking and that for sure can happen in the not-so-distant future, if not already happening now, give a try to black mirror.a very interesting point is, they're not \\\"distant-future\\\" sci-fi stories, but relate to common people on the everyday use of our beloved gadgetry, the lack of regulation, the lack of privacy ... some of the stories are already happening today: bullying, video-recording in everyone's pocket, streaming of private life ... if you like technology you'll love black mirror.\",\"more fun than a saturday night gane of pocket billiards. makes you want to do push ups and a shot of creatine. i feel a sense of optimism and faith in humanity returning. lets make viewing entertainment great again.\\n10 out of 10 dg's\",\"was recommended this show by a lot of people who's opinion i normally trust, but after watching the show i'm left guessing myself; \\\"am i the weird one?\\\" everyone else likes this show yet i find it lacking.first off the show looks amazing, at least most of the episodes. the distinct styles are all very original and beautiful to look at, for the most part. i would especially pull forward the episodes: \\\"the witness\\\" and \\\"the secret war\\\" as being very aesthetically pleasing. but this is not one of my criticisms of the show, my disappointment is with the writing.i feel like (almost) all episodes creative compelling worlds but fail to tell an engaging story within them. very few of the episodes take advantage of the short format to create a compelling story, the only ones in my opinion are \\\"beyond the aquila rift\\\" \\\"when the yogurt took over\\\" and \\\"zima blue\\\". these are well built stories that fit within the length of their episodes and don't overstay their welcome. a lot of the other episodes feel less like a tv-show and more like a tech-demo for a new game engine.also what's the deal with including cats in like every episode?\",\"some episodes are a bit dull, but i wouldn't miss them for a second. each and every one worth a watch.some of them were just stunning in animation and story line and i would love to see them as a full movie or series 😍\",\"episode two is the most profound artistic statement i've ever seen on any medium. the monologue by the dude at the end is probably the best bit of acting i've ever seen. next level s#!t. i was going to leave this review at that but imdb says it must be a minimum of 10 lines. all i can say is this show is truly visionary and probably too far ahead of it's time for a lot of people to really appreciate. people who are looking for something new, unique, interesting, thought provoking, disturbing, intelligent, spectacular, sensational, prophetic, well executed, superbly written, directed, and performed, will enjoy this program. the first episode was one of the most disturbing things i've ever seen on film, but was so well done and engaging i couldn't look away... or sleep afterward. the second episode just takes filmmaking to a whole new level. the third episode doesn't let up and is brilliant in it's own way. i haven't gotten to the second season yet, but i've seen enough to easily give it ten stars.\",\"i was recommended to watch \\\"love, death & robots\\\" by one of my friends, so i decided to give it a chance, despite being initially deterred by it being an animated show.well, it turns out that i would definitely have been missing out on something quite unique, bordering on being extraordinary, had i not decided to sit down and watch it. and i ended up binge watching all episodes of the first season in rapid succession. yeah, it was actually that interesting.the stories, despite being relatively short in playing time, were all very interesting, and they were all very different from one another. i was adequately entertained by all segments in season one, aside from the one with yoghurt - as it was just downright ludicrous.i liked the variation in different art and animation styles, because it gave the show a very unique quality. and it made it all the more fun to watch, compared to if every single story had been presented in the same manner of animation and art style.one thing that stuck out like a sore thumb, however, was the pointless display of nudity in many of the segments. it felt forced and just dumbed down the segment unnecessarily. they should not have opted to force in all the nudity, because it served no purpose whatsoever.the animation was quite interesting and top notch in each segment, despite the varied styles used. so there definitely is something for almost everybody here. the voice acting was also quite good.all in all, \\\"love, death & robots\\\" is definitely worth checking out, and i am quite glad that i did.\",\"not all episodes are good but 90% are very creative and thought provoking pieces of art.\",\"this show was recommended to me by my nyu graduate brother for film. he produces commercial film. every time he recommends some show or movie or mentions it, i check it out and this one was just so unexpected. this is meant for high iq people or people with a higher illuminated intellect. if not you will not understand it or understand why it has such high ratings. if you don't know if you have the intellect to watch the show, watch the first episode & then continue to the 2nd. you will see 2 drastic changes in between the two. if you understand after episode 2-3 what is going on, then you're stuck on this and now have been enlightened. good luck on the binge then waiting a year for 3 episodes like the rest of us. - og imdb user reviewer.\",\"the first one i watched had to do with an iphone type phone rating folks. funny.i watched two horrific ones i can never get over. (will explain more if anyone cares.)watched at least one great one. two lovers spend eternity together using a server farm. they are lgbt but it doesn't matter, could have been any gender, any choice, was only related to love and decisions and eternity.\",\"i found myself irritated with one of the reviewers who gave this mini-series a terrible review because it left him feeling \\\"disturbed\\\". ermm.... i think that's the intention....as many others have pointed out, the series is superbly put together: the actors are great; the script, if anything, is minimalist and the production excellent.this isn't reality tv. this picks out the darkest aspects of how are future in this this modern age could end up, in extremis....personally, i think it's a facebook\\u002ftwitter\\u002fflickr\\u002fandroid\\u002fiphone\\u002ftab\\u002finternet horror story and whilst i think it's probably too brutal for most people, it is a reflection of how we give up and of ourselves to the digital, overwhelmingly public way that the world now wants us to be.i love the show. will it change my fb or other behavior? no but, truth be told, i might be watching out of the corner of my eye....\",\"so this theme is exactly what i like to see more, every episode following a particular storyline in short times just like books.and because of that maybe it's better to rate each chapter on the specific episode section on imdb and rate the whole series based on the overall conclusion, isn't it?this type of thing will never get boring for long and endless series.\",\"\\\"love, death & robots\\\" is exactly what today's film industry needed. unfortunately, nowadays you see very often that the same concept is produced over and over again and sold as \\\"new\\\". the series shows that things can be done differently if you put more work into a project than just a lunch break. the series is just finally something fresh and beautiful!each episode presents a new story with a new animation style. because of this, it's hard to get bored.because of this each and everyone also has their favorite episodes and we get to experience something completely new with every episode.i hope netflix keeps this series alive for a long time!\",\"a series of unrelated episodes. without a development from the beginning of a story as a background setting, they're just drop you to some point in the story and finishing it up usually with half closure. sometimes with satisfying progress or sometimes ending closure. anyway these are each in the category of short film. some are interesting and some were just midling. it's like they ripped an interesting part of a full film, but only the interesting part -- according to the writers.i wonder if these were written for people with short attention span. anyway most of the animations graphic are of good quality.\",\"what a truly brilliant series! \\\"nosedive\\\" is a masterpiece. just skip season 5 please.\",\"clearly created both by and for a generation that has grown up deeply embedded in video games, love, death & robots inevitably seems to reflect a similar drop in attention span and a curiously singleminded focus on surface shocks and flashy spectacle at the expense of everything else. indeed, the storylines (and animation) often feel like little more than intros to games, with as much depth, believability and emotion.the visuals are, admittedly, continually impressive, but there's really almost nothing at all supporting them: the dialogue is lame, cliched and forgettable throughout, the storytelling very weak, practically every joke falls flat, and the voice acting is gratingly amateurish more often than not.it's clear comparisons will be drawn between this and, say, black mirror, in that they are both comprised of short, standalone stories dealing mostly with technology and the future, but unlike black mirror, at no point does any episode make you think deeply about... well, anything, and no idea raised is fleshed out enough to feel you've been shown anything of any worth. the good news is that, since the episodes are only 15 minutes long anyway, you don't feel particularly cheated, at least at first, but after you've watched a bunch of them, you do begin to wonder what the point of it all is.the better episodes are the witness, suits and shape-shifters, so i'd recommend checking those out first if curious.\",\"all stories are really good and made for short film. perfectly designed characters and detailing. i liked all episodes but personally didn't like some 2d which felt like old school cartoon. some sort of imagination and fiction are really appreciated and somewhere 3d characters was so detailed and look like real human. i would definitely watch follow-up seasons. also, i appreciate all the actors, writers and vfx animator guys for their absolute best performance. somewhere i saw adult content that would probably should avoid so all can see on large screen together. i recommed to watch who has short amount of time and to eager to see climax.\",\"good show, some of the stories felt like a wild acid trip, over all fun and creative\",\"ok, i know i'm late to this party but you might be too & looking for something truly exciting, smart & weird to stream (each episode like an exquisite film), you gotta check this out. i've never been a big sci-fi fan but this is something different: a twilight zone for the 21st century. pretty much the best thing we've seen on netflix, an original series w\\u002f the bbc. charlie brooker rules.\",\"i don't understand some people give low rating, it is at least a 8. some people think the stories too shallow, how do you manage to put a lot of idea together within 20minutes and try to be extremely profound? it is like blame the restaurant don't give you stainless fork and knives and champagne while you eating a plate of delicious fries. i think every episode is thoughts provactive more or less. i enjoyed every one of them. overall, it is really good experiment on different genres of animations and themes, the stories are short enough to avoid letting you get bored and keep you interested, and they are also of great cinematic hype with excellent quality of animation. i hope netflix can do more of this, let more directors and writer show off their ideas, good or bad, as long as it is short, lol.\",\"each episode has something to offer and nothing to take from the viewer..all of the episodes have excellent animation, that can be safely considered as a stand-alone success..to make matters best, the script & dialogues are genious, the plot is unbelievably complete and interesting for such short duration and the underlying messages are equally easy and hard to get\",\"breathtaking animation and superb writing makes this series refreshing and exciting theough its 18 episodes.\",\"this show is absolutely bonkers with violence, explicit scenes, and episodes. from minds of tim miller and david fincher made a show with great animation of a mix with twilight zone and black mirror story telling. buckle up for a wild ride!\",\"if it's one thing i cant stand, is \\\"reviews\\\" who make a statement. \\\"this is not for us, but for the 7 % political\\\". wtf? you speak for everyone? no need to take me to your leader, then. you're it. it's not for everyone. it's an anthology show, gloomy, black comedy, dystopian, violent. it's no light in the end, as you would expect from david fincher. and not all episodes will be your cup o'tea. i adored the start with the 3 bots, with cats the new rulers of a destroyed mankind. and i loathed the cagematch between the... somethings. that's what a show like this brings. you will not like everything. just like black mirror. that's why i give it 7\\u002f10. because you'll need some perspective. and btw, i don't even like animation. but seeing that episode with the ship who travelled... way too far. i was dumbfounded. the characters was so real, only my eyes finally saw something that told me that yes, this is animated. but bloody hell, they did a good job.\",\"while it is an anthology series, it doesn't need to feel like a collection of shorts that lack any substance. instead, these brief clips rely on circumstantial twists to leave the viewer with an impression that won't survive repeated viewings. its an \\\"adult\\\" animated series peppered with neadless language, nudity and violence that, ironically, will appeal to every 12 year old boy. don't get me wrong, i enjoy all three quite a bit. i just know the difference between being entertained and being played.\",\"black mirror is a show that provides the important modern question that is very meaningful especially in this day and age. \\\"can technology go 'too' far?\\\" to put it very simply, it's sort of a modern form of the twilight zone. the show is easier to comprehend if you treat each episode as it's own separate universe. it has somewhat of a formula. each episode, there is a problem. however, there is a piece of new tech that perfectly tackles the problem. or so you think. unseen consequences come with this tech, creating a problem equal to\\u002f worse than before. for a show that sometimes follows such a basic formula, the plot is always fresh, new, and most importantly, interesting and thought provoking.there's a sort of unique feeling you get while you're watching black mirror. a mixture of horror along with the morbid intrigue of watching a car accident. a wonderfully constructed car accident at that. the further you go, the more horrified you are, but at the same time, are presented with a plot that unfolds brilliantly. the only preventing me from giving this a 10\\u002f10 was the fact some episodes were slightly dull in production. in any other show it would've been a good episode, however in the standards that black mirror sets within itself, some were lackluster. also, this show does not appeal to all. this is clearly visible even in this review section. there are either 8-10 ratings or 1-3 ratings. it's like geometry. you either like it, or you don't. of course, there are complaints in this review section. a common complaint is about the first episode. in the first episode there is a scene where the prime minister is forced to rape a pig. that scene of course was very obscene. and i can imagine a good amount of people were disgusted by that. they immediately saw the scene, exited out of the netflix and probably ranted online about how bad it was. they accuse black mirror of relying purely on shock value alone. this is far, far from the truth. the whole episode was to show how someone can influence a population with a few posts online, and how effective it can be. they essentially criticized mob mentality, showing how flawed it really is. if you cannot find a pretty clear message from a television show which explicitly states it's lesson, you're probably a bit to young to watch this show.\",\"review for novastreamnetwork.comlove, death & robots is an artistically well written anthology series. its 18 episodes are all influenced by animation and is probably the most exciting series released on netflix in a very long time. the series is very nsfw with the amount of nudity and cursing in almost every episode. but the animation in every single one of these stories is unique in its own way. the short stories are easy to get through as they fly by and you'll wish it was a feature film.18 episodes, 18 short films, all under 20 minutes runtime. they're all science fiction based, and david fincher (gone girl) is the executive producer of this series. the idea came from none other than creator tim miller (deadpool). some of the shorts are based on literature, some are completely original stories being told in their own extraordinary way. they all have a different theme, a certain twist to them that leaves you begging for more and their own style of writing that makes every episode unpredictable. most of these \\\"mini-movies\\\" will make you think about things in a different way and truly blow you away. and yes, not every story will be your taste, but in my case, there were only two of them that didn't compel me in any way. some of the more endearing, longer episodes could easily be turned into blockbusters - the quality is just spectacular.whichever one will be your favourite, truly depends on your own personal taste. there's some very realistic animation in a few of them that makes you question if these are real actors on screen (there's only one episode that actually uses real life actors without any mocap) or computer-generated images. some other styles reminded me more of a european animated style and even manga passes by.like i said before, there's a lot of nudity and swearing, and in some of the episodes it feels a little bit out of place. mostly because of the animation style that feels more \\\"kid-friendly\\\" - don't get me wrong, this show is strictly for adults only! but other than that, in some episodes it really adds to the whole of the story.a reoccurring theme is obviously the titular three - love, death and robots. these three themes will either go hand in hand with each other and other times you'll only see one of these incorporated into the story. it all depends on the subject. ideas around humanity's future, our own demise and the relationship we have with space and other species is explored over and over again. it never feels preachy throughout the series and makes you laugh, feel sad or truly terrify you.each and every animator that has worked on this is talented and has their own vision on how to tell a story with their certain technique of animation. the beautify of this anthology series is that there's going to be something for everyone.top 3 episodes:episode 1 - sonnie's edge: in the underground world of \\\"beastie\\\" fights, sonnie is unbeatable - as long as she keeps her edge.\\nepisode 14 - zima blue: the renowned artist zima recounts his mysterious past and rise to fame before unveiling his final work.\\nepisode 2 - three robots: long after the fall of humanity, three robots embark on a sightseeing tour of a post-apocalyptic city.bottom 3 episodes:episode 8 - good hunting: the son of a spirit hunter forges a bond with a shape-shifting huli jing.\\nepisode 13 - lucky 13: after the drop-ship lucky 13 lost two crews, no pilot would fly her... but rookies don't get a choice.\\nepisode 18 - secret war: elite units of the red army fight an unholy evil deep in the ancient forests of siberia.love, death & robots is one of the most unusually artistic shows of the year. don't miss out on watching this asap!love, death & robots is available to stream on netflix.\",\"one of the most beautiful and creative collections of animations and cgi. the story, the colours. wow. i can't wait to see the next season. please do it again soon. i am so hanging out. this is an outstanding piece of creativity.\",\"as beautiful as the technology is, what a horrible way to spread fear and hate in the world, only makes me realise how much anger people have in their heartwhy not use that technology to spread light and positiveness?of course everything is so well made, you basically cannot critique the beauty of the animation which is top but i cannot fathom how much despair and darkness is show trough these short animations.im tired of seeing people use cgi only to convey pain and suffering, obviously there are better ways to use it.\",\"within 17 minutes this episode fit so much into it. with so many twists and turns. it really seemed like as each minute passed the show only got better. the ending was full of surprise. this one episode could be the base of an entire series. just wow.\",\"all the episodes have a good setup with nice story line. the idea behind the films also makes you will need to think about it. som episodes are quite close to what is going to happen in the future now. really like this serie.\",\"there are 2 or 3 episodes which i would say are good.\\nhowever, the rest is predictable, too unrealistic.there is too much wanton sex and violence in some scenes. just flashy, trying to seek attention.\",\"love the style of stories showing the flaws and grotesque of human nature.a perfect mirror for us to realize our path is far worse than we think. it's time to wake up and change our attitude...\",\"some of the animation here is on another level. episode 3 is just utterly sublime, i just am blown away. we are witnessing the next generation of entertainment. to all to were party to this, we're just in awe. go for it!\",\"i like love, death & robots - the show reminds me fondly of those comic sci-fi and fantasy anthologies or mags like heavy metal that i read in my younger days. and yes, not every episode is phenomenal but some are really good, and almost every story is based on some good idea, sometimes even unique, and some twists in the end are just too delicious - the animations are mostly eye candy too. no doubt, interesting for every lover of sci-fi, fantasy and the art of horror, and the short episodes make it a quick and well tasting snack in between.\",\"my words will not do this production justice.just watch it.\",\"i think this show might be one of the most important shows our new young generation of humanity has been miraculously gifted lately. this show can send us some of the most disturbing truths out there that we, today's rats, consumers, and sheeple have to adopt and understand. this show is a must.\",\"i couldnt tell i was watching black mirror through the whole 6th season. all the time i was waiting for that mind-f black mirror moment and plot where i really pause to process but i didn't get any.on joan is awful salma presence felt like she was shooting a commercial rather than filming tv and wro wasn't strong.. such a waste for the amount of talented actors and actresses in 1 episode.on the loch henry, it really felt just like watching a documentary, any random documentary only showing you behind the scenes except for the ending.mazey day, was a don't look up wannabe tv which is very mediocre.i don't know what's happening to the show but bring us black museum, white christmas, nosedive, white bear, playtest creators...chatgbt, tiktok, crypto, podcasts...all of these addictive concepts and you went with a documentary...\",\"i watched an old uk tv series some time ago called monkey dust and just loved (and missed) it to bits. now with l,d&r its brought it all back. dark! awesome! series 3 very soon please.\",\"wow!! the animation style is amazing. but unfortunately i can't watch more because even each episode is short, i still like anthology like what black mirror did. that is one great point that being string of each episode.\",\"great short stories with top notch animation\\nyou should give it a try its worth watching yeah i know some episodes are okaish but as i said before many great episodes delivering some message with a unique style of animation in each episode its intriguing and insanity hooks from 1st to last.\",\"the depth that british drama can explore is really unmatched by other industries. the power of the media, the will of the public, and the erosion of consumerism brought about by advanced technology have fallen into the past. each episode is wonderful and worth pondering.\",\"these episode are all differend, you can start with a random episode. each episode contains a differend story and that makes it so awesome! i recommend this series for all the people who likes a little mindblow. all the episode has a story in the future, past or present. pro tip: don't give up on the first episode, i found the first one a little bit to much, but on the other hand it was interesting how it can be if it was bassed on a true story.\",\"i don't understand the high rating. at first i thought it was all paid reviews, but it turns out some people actually like this show. the animation is charming in places. otherwise you'll find the worst writing you've ever encountered with pointless storylines. shockingly terrible. don't waste your time.\",\"this is not fun watching-it's mostly horrifying-but even if our brave new world is inescapable, the show represents a kind of protest that feels more necessary than ever.\",\"i enjoyed less of the shorts than i had hoped but not so few that i feel this was a waste of time. especially since the episodes themselves were so short.speaking of which, so many of these stories could have been greatly improved if they had more time to flesh out their concepts and characters. as they are, there is often not enough time to get invested and to really feel the impact of what the writers want you to feel.i enjoyed the different and unique styles of animation, except for the hyper realistic animation used across multiple episodes. only sonnie's edge used it well by still being heavily stylised and having some interesting lighting. the others all looked like video game cutscenes in the worst way. it didn't help that most of those episodes had some of the weakest stories as well.so, most of these stories include nudity and swearing to some extent because this is not for kids. honestly, it didn't bother me all that much, except in a few episodes where it definitely felt forced. did we really need a topless protester in the yogurt episode? kudos to them for keeping the male to female nudity ratio pretty even by my count.with the series title of love death + robots, you would expect at least one, if not all of those things in every episode, but some episodes' attachment to those themes are a bit of a stretch. hopefully season 2 is a bit more thematically focused.overall, i like that this show exists as a vehicle for animators to get their foot in the door and experiment a bit, even if that means that not every episode is going to land successfully.\",\"i love anthropology series, but this one took the trophy. each story has hidden messages that correlate to our current era of issues. it makes you think! while i was watching my brain was going crazy deciphering the hidden messages and creating ideas for stories. it's fuel for imagination. i hope the gods keep this show rolling in the long haul. i must thank the creators.\",\"was very excited for this new series, but right off the bat, the very first episode was immediately one for the garbage can. it's not just that the cringe-inducing cliched characters are straight out of a 10 year old's imagination---wannabe toughs replete with vile temperaments and non-existent personalities---but the swift and enthusiastic embracing of the \\\"men are toxic\\\" and sjw class-warfare tropes are both prime examples of coming from simpletons, serving only to intentionally insult the majority audience (sorry, not sorry, snowflakes) such a series depends on for its very existence. i don't need yet another thinly disguised rant on imaginary societal ills.\",\"it's an anthology so some might not be as good as others but there is certainly something for everyone. except kids this show is extreme in some of the episodes. absolutely cant wait for the next season\",\"in every episode you are going to see that the story will be connected to technology . some may say that all the episodes are not connected but i would say yes because you will spot some elements from previous if you are an observer . this is one of the best series on netflix i have watched which makes me long for more . credit to the makers on how they have used the technology so well.\",\"if the pilot episode had a female prime minister people would be outraged and the next episode, as boring as watching paint dry.\",\"love, death & robots is an anthology of animated science-fiction shorts. a few stories use live actors but heavy use of animation in the whole. most of the animation is cg-- some might be hand-drawn or might be really well stylized cg, i'm not sure.the animation itself is stunning. this is next-gen. there are a wide variety of styles on display, but it's all great, as good as anything i've ever seen, and that's including the old masters. i mess about with 3d modelling, and the cg stuff is really breathtaking in the detail and in the bridge between style and realism. these are people who know their art.the stories themselves are very, very similar to those that you'd find in the old days in heavy metal-- the movie or the magazine. that means gratuitous sex, gratuitous violence; it means a certain aesthetic, focused on science-fiction-cool; it means cleverness, occasional humor, and plenty of weirdness. i wouldn't have expected good stories from a movie like this, yet ldr mostly delivers on that front: its narratives are well paced and enjoyable.maybe its main weakness-- assuming gratuitous sex and violence doesn't turn you off- is its character writing. the characters may be modelled and animated nearly perfectly, but as characters they're still pretty two-dimensional. but i'm not sure how much anyone could expect from an anthology series on this front, and poor characterization is pretty much the rule in this genre.if you're a fan of science fiction or animation, and the sex and violence doesn't turn you off-- really, it's just there for its own sake, although some of us think that's fine-- then i think ldr will blow you away.\",\"one thing i noticed as i went through this series, if the episode has a soft core porn scene in it then it gets rated 2 points higher than it should. overall the series is ok, some very few episodes are really good, but the strange mix of \\\"here's a comedy, here's a porn, here's a mind bender\\\" just doesn't seem to work any better than randomly googling \\\"short videos\\\" and putting youtube on autoplay.\",\"this is the most beautiful animation i have ever seen. each episode has it's own unique style, and the cgi and face renderings are completely natural. the narratives are easy to get absorbed into, and the short runtimes of each episode makes this anthology easy to binge. i could watch about 10,000,000 episodes of this show. hopefully it wins some animation awards.\",\"the best mini series ever seen, all episodes are amazing even some of them seemed similar but all stories are brilliant , the most episodes i like are ;\\nwhite christmas, hated in the nation, men against fire, fifteen million merits & white bear . for now iam waiting for season 4 ,so if you like drama you will see it as a piece of art .\",\"my cliche is that this is the first time i have felt compelled to review. that took me by as much surprise as this original work of art on netflix. it's not for everyone, but what is, life has become homogenised enough. the sheer volume of repetitive durge that is spued out as so called 'entertainment' today makes it difficult to find genuinely original and mentally challenging works but this series of shorts hits the nail clearly on the head.\\nit's been a while since i have genuinely been challenged; by both the narrative and the superb visual feast of this wonderful anthology.\",\"anyone who grew up in the 90's should remember liquid television. it gave us the original aeon flux and the first real hd animation. this is very reminiscent. the animation is great and even when it is not, it still fits the style. it should also be said that mtv liquid television was rated tv-14, this is very much deserving of its tv-ma rating.\",\"worst script i have ever encountered. in the same league as the lowest budget teen tv series from disney channel. i am almost a little bit impressed by how bad it was and how painful it was to watch.\",\"finally got some time to watch the season. overall it is fun to watch most of the episodes with gorgeous animation and story twists. i would love to see episode 7,8 and 18 turn into a full movie. on the other hand episode 13's story is so lacking that i tried to fast forward although it is only 13 minutes.\",\"i started with \\\"three robots\\\" and thought it was cute and interesting. so i ventured further in. the deeper i got into other episodes, the more disappointed i became, and soon stopped trying. even the episodes that got the best reviews like \\\"good hunting\\\" were a turn off, leaving me feeling worse for having seen it. most of the stories were unimaginative predictable tropes of a psycopath acting with no motivation other than being cruel, and artificially created revenge situations. many of the stories were overly gory and predictable; i saw no point to, or redeeming quality in, most of them. frankly, i am sad that \\\"love, death and robots\\\" got such great reviews, not sure what that means.\",\"through stunning animation, the series illustrates surreal worlds and fantastical themes, and although at times the stories are hard to digest, they're certainly thought-provoking and worth discussing.\",\"some episodes are better than others , but overall this is a great show. i also love the fact that the episodes are only 10 to 15 minutes long. honestly do yourself a favor and watch it!\",\"so, this popped up on my recommended viewing list on netflix... didn't know what i was in for, just bored and needed something to binge on.what a surprise! i just finished the third episode and am going to move on to more... really looking forward to seeing more! they are all separate stories with a common theme (so far): technology and humanity.from the title, i guessed it would be dark. but this really delves into what is so f'd up with society and just what technology is doing to us; a little scary and quite enlightening.i wouldn't recommend it for a first date night, but if you want to watch something to just reflect on while enjoying some fantastic acting, brilliant writing, or just to binge a little... or a lot, you're gonna be blown away. i'm sitting here writing this, still just a little disturbed at what i have watched. this is really one of those series that you just watch by yourself, with no distractions.\",\"black mirror is without a doubt one of the best television shows to come out of netflix within the 2010's decade, but what makes this show-stopping must watch different from the others?well for starters, black mirror doesn't just touch the surface, it dives straight into inquisitive storylines that keep audience members on their toes the entire time, and creates it's own universe of futuristic storytelling with intelligent depictions of the future world with technology's massive influence. no two mirror black mirror episodes are the same, but the creators of each episode themselves link every episode together through its overarching themes of technology and it's effect on the future world.along with black mirror's a-list starring cast beginning from miley cyrus all the way to jon hamm and daniel kaluuya from horror blockbuster 'get out', black mirror isn't shy about what it's intentions are, and it really is a refreshing take on a universal series. it rarely ever missing the mark, and never fails to keep audience members entertained while binge watching on a week night.\",\"what we have here is a show which is a disturbing commentary on the way that technology could lead society down a route that shapes our societies in a way that we never wanted it to. if you're new to the show, don't be put off by the first episode. first of all, it is probably the least black mirror like episode, but also consider that just because it is disturbing (as anyone in their right mind would say), it does say a lot about the people using that technology. currently as of october 2018, there are 4 series out and series 1 and 2 are purely based in england and series 3 and 4 are mixed between england and the united states (although sometimes filmed elsewhere). the tone of the show definitely changes, but not necessarily in a bad way, however the american episodes seem to be somewhat glossier made though don't have quite the storyline that the english episodes have. for series 5, i'd like to see some more money spent on those episodes based in england. the episodes are consistently well thought out, though sometimes \\\"a leap of faith\\\" is required in the odd episode as the concepts don't fully add up if you scratch beneath the surface. it does however provide excellent drama. this is up there with 'breaking bad' for being a well written series with ideas that are there to challenge our ways. a lot of people give a lot of credit to charlie brooker, but i'd also like to add annabelle jones and other contributors. if you watch it and feel that you can't watch any more as it is too sick, give it a day or two and watch some more.\",\"when i talk about this show i always tell people to \\\"just skip the first episode and watch it at the end.\\\" other than that it's a mind blowing, ground breaking, and terrifying series. it shows exactly where humankind is currently heading and has already reached in some instances. a mirror can only show a reflection of what's already there so black mirror is an apt title.i've watched all the episodes multiple times and wish like crazy they had continued the show. it was one of the truly rare shows willing to take an unflinching look at humanity and how screwed up it is, and how much worse it's getting. in my experience, those who don't like the show seem to prefer living with their head in the sand while humming loudly to drown out the noise. ignorance doesn't change the world, seeing it for what it is and then choosing to be better is what can do it.\",\"this show is on one hand, extremely freaking weird. but on the other hand it shows great animation and interesting stories. the show is very watchable. but sometimes there are way to much stuff going on to where it is weird or just makes no sense. but overall it is a fun show, and if you like shows like twilight zone and black mirror then you will love this.\",\"as a kid, i was raised on the twilight zone. it is fair to say that black mirror is the best series i have come across. every episode is its own plot with its different cinematography, soundtrack, and characters. it is a series that has perfected their own thought provoking, futuristic, mind blowing screenwriting. just as twilight zone was set in the future, so is black mirror. but it is not too radical of a futuristic rendition, rather it is just a small step forward on technology we have today. black mirror uses this aspect in ways to engage a emotional connection in its advantageevery episode is great, every season is great, we need more! - ansel ponce diama\",\"just made an account to rate this series. this should be enough information.\",\"this show has the gravitas of black mirror in the sense of it being a completely new level of quality for netflix. i am so used to being disappointed by the torrent of subpar shows on the streaming service.however, along comes this strange show a friend and i decided to try because the episodes were small and we needed to watch something offline for a drive. well, we were exchanging looks very soon, \\\"is this really that good?\\\"i was utterly floored by some of these episodes with their weighty themes condensed into ten minutes. i had to check many times to even be sure the episode was merely that short.!if you happen to not like a certain episode, give another a shot. this show is so beautiful. the artwork is surreal! but most importantly--- it's actually interesting and written very well!!!it's funny because i don't usually say this, but--- you wont be disappointed!!\",\"animation don't have his place in series, especially when some episode have 6 min lenght and look like a youtube video made by a real artist, i give +1 because of the episode 16

that's when i started to pay attention,\\nso now i have seen 11 episodes so far i have to write a review or say something about it, i was a little skeptical after the first episode but then after episode 2 i was hooked, this is a masterpiece pure and simple, some excellent quality stories and each episode's animation is differant, from computerised animation to anime and then to good old fashioned animation, then back to animation i've never seen before, i highly recommend watching this show even if you don't normally watch animation, it's all about the stories, my personal favorite so far would be between suits ep 4, sucker of souls ep 5 but good hunting is an awsome episode too, i have to say that suits reminded me of firefly the joss whedon cancelled way before its time show, i don't know why but it reminded me of that show, from the first 5 minutes i just thought firefly.? do yerself a favour and watch this series, bravo netflix keep on keeping on.\",\"this series is so mind-numbingly mediocre that i find myself wondering whether it was made by people who have been raised on video games and comic books and who never learned to read. none of these stories would have been accepted for publication back in the golden age of science fiction. their authors would have been laughed out the door and told never to submit anything ever again.\",\"we need more of this kind of shows where every episode tells a different story that is interesting and original!!!\",\"this show is a masterpiece. every episode feels like a complete movie. i was surprised that i was able to care for the characters after such a short time. most shows take 2 or 3 hours to be able to establish that kind of a rapport. the pacing is great, the topics explored are interesting and some of the plot twists are amazing. one of the episodes managed to flip my understanding of all the events completely on its head just in the last few seconds when the truth was finally revealed.\",\"mature,

humour, horrors then you will not like this show, it will bore you.i've read through some reviews people wrote that being shocked was the point of the show, i wasn't shocked, i was bored. i tried a couple of episodes in series 1 and one episode in series 4 just to see if it got better, arkangel was awful.\",\"wow , just an amazing show , best show on netflix , each episode is a journey and different story . \\nwhat makes this show an exceptional is that it's not just the new future technologies but mainly on the human nature and their interaction with this technologies .\\nblack mirror need more recognition in the awards galas like the emmy and the golden globe , charlie brooker is a genius producer and screenwriter .\",\"i don't even know what to say about it. just watch. you won't be sorry.\",\"not a hardcore anime fan but if i get a lot of recommendations, i am not averse to watching one. this one though has me yearning for more. new stories, awesome science fiction, adult themes, a lot of eye candy (and thats being very mild)...cant wait for more. its that one gem out of ten crappy movies\\u002fshows netflix is churning out these days.\",\"this is one of the best netflix shows i watched so far. it is really terrifying that all of these episodes of black mirror can be or is already applicable in real life. i really enjoy learning about the philosophy in each episode where everyone has to make a choice based on their moral judgments. whenever i watch an episode, i feel my eyes would explode with shockness. tik tok is the reason on how i got into this show on netflix. without tiktok, i wouldn't know about the show. this is how a good show should be like. i am glad this show exists. i remember having a weird dream and it reminds me of black mirror.\",\"the series is good but it can be really hurtful with the scenes and dialogues.\",\"viewers expecting a gleeful, feel-good television show will not find one in charlie brooker's \\\"black mirror\\\", a technology centric netflix series drenched in disturbing realities, social commentary and possible near-future outcomes. it is also a brilliantly-written anthology that serves as a 21st century twilight zone of sorts. each season builds around several aspects of modern tech and how we humans may abuse them and how that tech may haunt us come a few decades. yes, there have been one or two letdowns over the show's four year run, but all of them address key issues regarding modern day life and societal flaws, always remaining relevant and connected in some way. it's intimate and mature portrayal of people's lives affected by rogue tech is often disturbing, but thought-provoking and logical nevertheless. its a pessimistic, often times depressing viewing, but its so effectively brought to life and so authentic, that it makes you think... a lot.\",\"first, you can't just come here and review\\u002frate everything but one season. this is all quite immature. it's like most of you are throwing a tantrum because the show didn't come back exactly how you like it and need it to be.the entire show is awesome. yes, the first seasons are better, but i think season 5 is good, and a lot of 6. i love the red mirror episode.the disappointing thing is, a lot of you are only upset because of it not following some weird projected formula you came up with for it... as if it has to be that, or it's not black mirror. shows change all the time, and do new things, different things. at it's heart, the show was still very much black mirror. it's even more sad because we could have had a new show from them... but everyone got upset that it wasn't the same, instead of just trying to watch it. i would have personally loved red mirror...i agree that netflix ruins most things they touch, but you dont really know what you are talking about here. and talking about netfliz prices in a review? bananas.i hope they come back to the red mirror idea again some day, and someone is willing to let them do it. unfortunately everyone killed it...\",\"if i had to pick 5 words to describe black mirror it would be those. add that they're all exceptionally well- made pieces of art.recommended for appreciators of proper sci-fi, cerebral thought experiments, philosophy and those who wonder what modern social tech might be doing to our human nature. also if you enjoy anthologies ala outer limits & twilight zone.not recommended if you're in the mood for binging on 'just-one-more' series arcs or you fancy light entertainment. black mirror is heavy-going and encourages concentrated viewing and musing afterthoughts, personally i couldn't binge on it.i needed almost a month to watch all 19 eps, so about one a day which is as bingey as it should be. watch it in order as you get a little appreciation of how the bm-universe expands.one fine thing to point out is that black mirror's cast is genuinely diverse without making a crazed identity-politics agenda out of it...people are people, and that's how it should be.\\nmy ep rankings:10\\u002f10: hated in the nation \\u002f uss callister9\\u002f10: fifteen million credits \\u002f white christmas \\u002f the entire history of

very rare, and 9's relatively rare (about as rare as my 1\\u002f10's & 2\\u002f10's)...so props to bm for having five such exceptionally strong episodes, plus plenty of strong 8's. anything from a 6\\u002f10 is worth a watch, 5\\u002f10 is borderline ok so that leaves just the one genuinely poor story. oddly enough those three weakest eps all came in a row, tho' of course your experience will differ.weighting the balance positively black mirror deserves an overall 9\\u002f10 putting it right up there in my top 5 favourite series ever, above game of thrones & breaking bad. alongside twin peaks & classic twilight zone. below only the modern battlestar galactica.so if you haven't seen any yet and my spoiler-free review speaks to you, i can only add don't judge the series on its very first episode (it strongly divides opinion), the next two however should blow you away!\",\"this is incredibly good, but the \\\"love\\\" thing did not really happen, there was a little sex here and there, but in my opinion not enough. that's why i'm only giving 9\\u002f10. the rest is perfect, i love gore etc.\",\"black mirror impressively ties together its standalone episodes, hinting at shared elements that keep viewers engaged in the same universe. this smart storytelling allows each episode to shine on its own while subtly suggesting connections to previous stories. it's like connecting the dots in a complex puzzle, creating a cohesive narrative world that viewers can immerse themselves in.each episode of black mirror sparks deep thinking, encouraging viewers to ponder the \\\"what if\\\" scenarios that are at the heart of science fiction. by exploring the potential impacts of new technologies, the show prompts us to consider how they might shape society and individuals. this mix of imagination and social commentary is what makes black mirror so fascinating to watch and discuss.the unsettling storyline of s3ep5 serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by government overreach, leaving viewers feeling uneasy and suspicious of authority. it's a wake-up call about the risks of surveillance and manipulation, leaving a lasting impression. as the series progresses, it delves into darker themes, exploring the complexities of human nature and technological progress.with each season, black mirror continues to push boundaries, delivering moments that provoke strong emotional reactions. whether it's intense scenes of violence or shocking plot twists, the show keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. it's a thrilling roller coaster ride, leaving audiences both captivated and unsettled by its thought-provoking insights.\",\"it blew my mind. watching these episodes are like tripping! amazing creation. quick episodes like the quick bites or naps. watch it guys. this is next level.\",\"the animation is stunning, the stories are great and many of the episodes could easily adapt into full tv shows. maybe not the episode with the intelligent yoghurt, that was pretty out there, but again, i'd be curious enough to see where it goes. very very recommendable!\",\"i did not sugn up for satanic horror... please!!! ugh! it was the worst season ever!!! just dark with no redeeming qualities. i loved the scifi future stuff. but his??werewolves? demons? murderers?? nothing but just horror genre, and not even original!! come on netflix... you can do better! just really dissapointing and right in line with the current satanic end of the world prep agenda. look at the nice s for satan, i mean streamberry. and then sort of making demons & murderers look ok?? it's all just a big dissapointment and should come with a warning that this show is not family friendly anymore!\",\"the worst episodes are still better than 90% you see anywhere. the best episodes are from another level... never seen this before!\",\"note : genius\\nscale :beauty\\nnever saw something like it\\njust incredible\",\"i am not a fan at all of animation stuff, nor modern scifi and fantasy too. but this series which was advised by a friend amazes me, because it is so gloomy, dark, disturbing, maybe too complex though, that i am addicted to it. unfortunately, most of those stories could not be adapted for the big screen in classic regular movies. too shocking for most audiences. i highly recommand it to anyone seeking something different. don't expect happy endings here, no do not, you would be deceived. or maybe once in a while.\",\"such an amazing and weird show. first two episodes i found a bit boring but after that every episode is a ridiculously creative, strange and mysterious. it's like black mirror x10. the short episodes make it easy to watch also.\",\"i'm giving this 9\\u002f10 out of 10 stars, because the viewing experience is really up there (i don't think there wasn't a moment where i didn't feel something per film), and it's beautifully crafted. i'd say it lost a star simply because some of the shorts weren't long enough.this anthology seems to pay homage to the whimsy and fascination of old sci-fi films and animation, with a breathtaking new aesthetic from the possibilities of today's technology. it offers multiple perspectives of the state of the world today, and what could be, and even defines experiences with a lot more depth than previously imagined.the series offers a wide array of touching stories, each complimenting each other with the emotions it evokes. from tragedy, to romance, comedy, satire, anger, hopelessness, and a deep sense of warmth.the aesthetics are absolutely beautiful, and the exploration of stories through a sci-fi lens is refreshing. it feels new, fresh, and looks into the 'what-if' of life. this has left me with a feeling of whimsy and fascination, something i haven't felt from watching something in a long time.i've been a fan of tim miller since his gwtdt sequence, and i'm so glad he's been given another moment to shine, alongside with the animators who also deserve this moment. i sincerely look forward to seeing more from him.i'm so pleased netflix gives artists a platform to showcase their work. you can see the passion, the exploration, and the creative expression in this anthology series.if you are looking to be intrigued, are a fan of sci-fi themes, and want to explore the possibilities of what animation can do, or simply seeking mental enrichment, this show is for you.\",\"i highly, highly recommend love, death & robots. easily one of my favorite shows of all time, and i am so, so happy it's been approved for a third season.the animation is always on point. some episodes are absolutely beautiful masterpieces. there are some very creative ideas and storylines. some episodes had me in tears, others had me gasping in shock. plenty of variety. the whole thing was an emotional rollercoaster.everyone seems to have extremely different reactions to each of the episodes, as is extremely apparent by every ranking list i've seen so far. so just try to go in with an open mind and just experience them all. if you know you're particularly sensitive to a certain theme (the violence and\\u002for nudity can be very intense at times), i'd recommend looking that up in advance.the second season was a bit of a disappointment. it felt like the creators had listened a bit too much to the critics, and it's ended up really watered down. but in spite of that, this show has barely dropped at all, in my eyes. there are still absolutely fantastic episodes, and they are still absolutely worth a watch. who knows, you might really love them.either way, go watch it! fingers crossed for third season.\",\"best show i've ever seenso funny to read reviews of people who hated it... all of them say something like \\\"i watched the 1st episode and...bla bla\\\"...indeed the 1st episode is the most scandalous of them all...maybe that's why they made it episode 1? if you don't like this, this show isn't for you...go watch breaking bad or something\",\"well it offer something new certainly. i really like the video game cutscene vibe. not all episodes are breathtaking though.\",\"though i loved this anthology and some of the episodes are truly fantastic, i am disappointed to see almost no female directors and only one female writer in 3 seasons.in the first season (the longest) there are no women at all behind the scenes- only on camera. (not always with their clothes off, to be fair.)it left a bad taste in my mouth.im so happy to see animators working. its such a difficult industry to produce in and yet, this series did not even try to let any female animators (and they are legion) tell their stories. im positive there are women out there who have sexy, freaky, horrifying stories to tell.do better.\",\"pretentious, predictable, pathetic attempt for sci-fi.it's really bad.\",\"the animation is next level but the individual 'stories' lack narrative. while some of them are pretty straightforward you often feel like you're being dropped into the middle of a film just as the action begins, left to piece together whatever you can.\",\"you have no excuse for not watching it. you want to see how a movie (short film) ca be a form of art? watch this. it will leave you wanting for more.\\nfor so much more...\",\"i really wanted to like these new black mirror episodes but they were simply not it. the only good thing about this season was aaron paul who is simply a baller in everything he is in. other than that, these episodes are a waste of time and no where near the true original black mirror episodes. it's like they locked the original writers in a room and made them watch a bunch of leftist nonsense until there writing abilities sucked and changed completely. man i loved black mirror and this ruined it for me. fire these writers and get the originals back. not sure why you would fire them or get replacements. please make season 7 solid. that's all i ask.\",\"unique in its delivery, love, death + robots is enjoyably inconsistent across episodes. all loosely sticking to the titular theme, brilliant instances of action, horror, romance and comedy are shown in alternate episodes, largely to a high quality. not all are as good as others, but they are all so bitesize, usually lasting between 10-15 minutes, that catching an episode is refreshing no matter the genre.graphic and certainly for an adult audience, the animators do not shy away from anything on screen. plus, as the story changes each time, so too does the animation, ranging from the life-like (or using live action) to video game graphics, cartoons and animé, every one is unique.each installment is unlike the last, and the series is unlike anything else too.\",\"every episode brings something awesome to this party of a series\",\"well, season 1-4 is a solid 9 for me. really, really good tv.this newest installment however is not. i guess it's all right for a quick watch - but it is not classic black mirror worthy material.the mind bending and often dark moments are completely gone.3 out of 5 episodes would've fit better under del toro's cabinet of curiousities, which were funnily enough also very lacking (not very del toro ish, eh?)i think the culprit here is netflix.almost anything produced by nf these recent years has been creatively lacking and dragged out to keep view score up. looking at stranger things, the witcher and cabinet of curiousities. only better call saul managed to stay consistent till the end, in my opinion.it's a shame really.kudos to aaron paul for a solid performance in this seasons best episode. unfortunately it suffered under lazy writing, became a drag and ultimately failed as a bm episode.i'm just glad brooker made season 1-4 which i'll happily rewatch now and then. thank you.\",\"i've just discovered the extraordinary showstopper, \\\"black mirror\\\", a british sci-fi television series that is part \\\"twilight zone\\\" but darker and more bizarre. in six episodes in season one we are let into a dystopian future narratively thrilling yet outrageous, because of its plausibility. each episode, like \\\"twilight zone\\\", has a separate story and a different cast. you can view the episodes in any order. more a short story collection than a novel, \\\"black mirror\\\" is less a dystopia than it is the dark side of life and the darkest regions of the mind. read the entire review at: www.unhealedwound.com under the december 29, 2014 post: \\\"black mirror\\\"--\\\"dark reflections of the mind.\\\"\",\"i'm sick of people comparing this to black mirror. they are nothing alike. most episodes in \\\"love, death & robots\\\" are just sci-fi themed randomness. there's no deeper meaning to any of the episodes, no thought-provoking questioning of the morality of tech. and that would be fine, but people who've never watched black mirror keep comparing the two, and it's annoying. please don't be that guy.\",\"this is animation at it's most provocative. i enjoyed every minute. please make more of this! my favorite episodes are zima blue, sonnie's edge, the witness, sucker of souls, good hunting, suits, and shape shifters. words cannot express this original, thought provoking, saga. netflix you are my entertainment central!!!\",\"i love science fiction genre and the show has completely lived upto my expectations .every episode is different and provides a new innovative idea .science fiction is generally difficult to portray but black mirror does it amazingly well. it can also be great for people who are on a tight schedule and get very less time to enjoy ,they could watch a single episode and be at work again unlike other shows in which we keep thinking what will happen next 😂 even when we are at work .a must watch show for people who want something new!\",\"excellent performance as my friend told about this and he gave a good review. no matter which language is used in the film.imdb is a great website and providing

short stories, though i don't recall seeing any actual \\\"love\\\" in any of the episodes. there was a lot of sex and nudity, which i get is essential to some of the plot lines. though i would indeed like to see more content like this on netflix, there seemed to be an unnecessary number of schlongs appearing in some of these episodes. i get the importance of nudity in some of the scenes, but excess is a turn off when i'm trying to engage with understanding a character and \\\"oh, look, it's another dick\\\". :(i also enjoyed the mix in animation types, though i must admit that the stories that interested me the most were primarily cgi (\\\"sonnie's edge\\\", \\\"beyond the aquila rift\\\", \\\"lucky 13\\\" and \\\"the secret war\\\"). this could be because they were the most intriguing stories, or that they were some of the longer ones, or because i am just use to this style as cutscenes for video games. either way, i would be interested in seeing full length features of each of these.the stories that seemed intriguing in concept but the weakest in this anthology in my opinion were \\\"the witness\\\", \\\"the dump\\\" and \\\"zima blue\\\", though each had their own \\\"a-ha\\\" moments.all-in-all, though, i would be willing to put up with a few stinkers in order to see some quality shorts in another round or two of anthologies like this. bring on \\\"sex, death, robots & monsters\\\" part 2.\",\"i was really looking forward to a new season as the first one really blew me away. it's always a pleasent surprise to see new episodes are in. half way in to s03 ep01 though i got really nauseous of all the political refrences. when it came to mars and the behavior of the wealthy i felt myself in a dnc conference. i would have prefered something more scifi and less political.if you are being political atleast don't be this far left. it just proves the critics that netflix has a woke mind virus as so many of the tech companies.\",\"black mirror is sci-fi high on shrooms: a very thought-provoking show, that will leave you with strong and very different thoughts and emotions after watching each episode. some episodes will uplift you, some will depress you. i personally cannot binge watch black mirror because it is just so draining to watch. each episode induces you to reflect on your humanity, your personal life, how you deal with society, how technology affects your connection to society, the future of technology, and many other things.each episode is a stand-alone episode (but is said to be occurring in one cinematic universe) so you can jump episodes and seasons (except for the last episode of season 4-- watch that last). different episodes have different characters (and i think writer and creators).black mirror is the modern version of the twilight zone. it combines various genres in a predominantly sci-fi theme, while providing a utopian or (mostly) dystopian satire of humanity's technology-dependent present and future.i highly recommended that you watch this show, especially if you belong to the young generation (after the millenials) who were born with all this \\\"high technology\\\" we now depend on. just be patient with season 1 because that's a pilot season-- most pilot seasons usually are just building the series' steam.\",\"so ill try to make it short as this season episodes areseason one had meanning and depth to

science fiction stories in mini bites, although some viewers may feel that there is too much unwarranted nudity.reminds me of watching cartoons when i was a kid with short enjoyable stories, but in genres that i now enjoy as an adult.at times, reminiscent of the old time tv series like twilight zone or steven spielberg's amazing stories for some of its twisted story telling.there is a mix of animation styles used from simple old-school 2d cartoons to really amazing modern 3d animation. all done tastefully and the complex 3d ones are captivating eye candy.\",\"(e03)pop squad was resembling

magic...when i saw david fincher mentioned i knew it will be a work of art.it consists of 18 episodes of different stories and art styles, all of them beautiful and intriguing. they will absorb you. they will make you laugh, question things, leave you mesmerized and sad, shocked and excited. wanting for more the most. and that is exactly why art exists. art style ranges from steampunk to mass

many if the stories were very lacking. some had bad punch lines, some had no punch lines, although some were pretty good. i definitely feel like a lot of the high ratings are based off people rating

change is the writing.\",\"love this every last one! couldn't even tell lucky 13 was animated. some were funny some made you think some had sad moment and some were scary (looking at you beyond the

different stories and different types that are mostly sci-fi and fantasy.my first impression about this series was a disappointment to be honest, then things turns to get more and more interesting, so it's not about the short movies or their stories actually, it's about the vibe that this show offers, those well animated short episodes were fascinating, the whole idea is great, it discusses the limits of a human's brain, the thing that animation can make it more realistic than a realistic show.my favorite ep was david fincher's episode(bad travelling)\\nand i'm hungry for more.\",\"i watched 4 random episodes over at a friends house last night. the best weighting was definitely the xmas episode that was about 7 minutes long, had hardly any dialogue and had a great twist on some thing we have all seen hundreds of times before in xmas themed media. after watching it i was intrigued to see more and was deeply disappointed.the other three episodes seemed like they were just looking for any excuse to cram as much violence, sex and ham-fisted political messages into the span of 30 minute episodes.i told my friend to turn it off after the good hunting episode. if this is what passes for \\\"amazing writing and art\\\" i guess i just don't understand.writers, please use your brain and write something that is deeper then just violence, sex and your played out politics.\",\"haven't finish all episodes, but despite just a short stories, the copywriting, storyline, character building, animation quality applied on character's emotion is ... i lost words.. words cant describe it..

even comically bad and stupid. and with technology they become even more evil and stupid.this is so primitive. but even this could have been executed in much better ways.it becomes stale so fast.\\\"okay, lets watch some black mirror. in what other way i am going to be told the same thing?\\\"and because of this strange \\\"agenda\\\", every episode becomes more and more bizarre.even funny in a bad way.and really-really boring.\",\"i am an anime watcher. sure i watch american animated shows and movies, sometimes european too. but for me anime as a form of animation and to an extend a storytelling is superior to something like final space or even rick and morty. that is why even though i watch western cartoons the number of them are much lower then the japanese.\\nhere comes love, death and robots that changes my perspective on animation. true cgi anime always has been poor and only currently it got better, but here in this show cgi animation is on the everest of quality and japanese still at the bottom.\\ni question myself and anyone else, with a top level like this, why bother hire live actors, some of the episodes look as real as live action movies.\\nthematically each episode is as different as the animation each one has. i would say this is the rare case where animation is more important then a plot, moreover it conveys more meaning then the story or dialogues. episode 3 has almost no lines but it is so impactful. indeed it is far from best episode in the season, but the point is , the image, the animation has ability to tell a story as much as a script.\\nsomething like episode 6 or 17 are the weakest both in animation and in the story, but they are still enjoyable.\\ni am looking forward to season 2. it is like black mirror being animated or even better.\",\"it is the best animated series i have ever seen. i'm in binge watched in one day and i'm loved it. i wish i could rate it 11. if this gets below 9 average, that'd be unfair.\",\"you've done it! i would love to see more of everything! of course, some clips were more interesting than others but hey! 10 outta 10!\",\"my guess is the raving reviews are written by teenage boys, it's the only explanation the ratings are so high. the creators are apparently teenage boys too, i mean it's hard to believe adult people actually produced this pile of drivel. it's badly written, incoherent, and basically just an excuse to squeeze in as many sex and violence as possible.\\nunbelievable what passes as \\\"art\\\" today.\",\"i actually dont watch sci-fi but black mirror is something different.\",\"i don't think i've been this hyped about a tv show in a long time.since i'm not a fan of episodic shows, i didn't expect much from this one. but all the different animations and drawing styles enchanted me. i kept waiting to see what the next episode would bring.love, death and robots has given us a wait to watch full movies in 15 minutes. every chapter develops new and complex stories without getting too overwhealming. it deals with subjects that, were they made into a movie, would probably be too cliché. but by only showing the climax of the stories, the show keeps you at the end of your seat constantly.filled with amazing and complex characters and a great number of plot twists that will blow your mind.and it's gory. so very, beautifuly gory. the level of violence is off the charts and i'll simply love it. the explicity and rawness of the show it's what makes it unique.i'm only taken a point away because there were 3 chapters (when the yogurt took over, alternative stories and zima blue) that i particulary did not like.still, the test of the 15 chapter were either good, great of fantastic.my favourite ones would be:\\n1- beyond the aquila rift\\n2- sonnie's edge\\n3-shape-shifters\\n4-helping hand\\n5-the secret war\",\"each and every episode is a masterpiece, written to perfection. every viewer will feel something different from what episode they've just watched. i know that after most episodes i feel a little frightened for my children as i am fully aware of what the future is bringing.\",\"short films are probably my favourite type of film. they're really the very essence of a story, stripped off of anything that is not essential, and it is because they are so condensed that they will leave you feeling very intensely about whatever is told.to me, this anthology, however, was a very nice animation around a whole lot of nothing, really. in general, the plots were very shallow, predictable and most of them made me feel like they didn't even have a proper ending! and i'm all for open endings, but i'm talking about no ending at all! and if no film is any good without a proper conclusion, this is even truer of short films. take \\\"fishy night\\\" for example: what a disappointing way to ruin such an interesting starting premise and gorgeous animation!in short, you can really tell they've invested quite a lot of money in the cgi. hopefully, in the future they'll invest in the plots too.\",\"upon viewing the first episode i wasn't sure how the show was going to progress. alas, the second episode is a completely different story. \\\"black mirror\\\" repeatedly and perfectly depicts what the future may hold for us as people of the world if we continue to increase our dependence and reliance on technology and social media respectively. as i believe the title is intended to foreshadow, it shows us a dark reflection of ourselves. the show eloquently brings to light how future technologies can make our lives immensely better, but as history has shown us, and as is depicted in the show, immensely better can easily become immensely problematic.as for my taste in shows, i appreciate developed characters and plot randomness or unpredictability. charlie brooker i applaud thee because the characters are consistently fully developed and you can never pin down where the episodes are going to go. the character development leads you to easily empathize with the various situations the series puts them in, and by the end of the episodes you'll find yourself evaluating their decisions as if they were you're close friends.brilliant execution, use of technology, and plot development - simply brilliant.\",\"this show is amazing, it's the animated version of black mirror, you should definitely watch it but try to do it slow or you'll regret having watched all the chapters too fast!!\",\"sonnie's edge - decent fights, \\\"edgy\\\"three robots - humorous

seem to hate it. reviewers who are saying s5 is not black mirror appear to want each episode to fit into a certain perceived format and anything outside of that is rubbish. stifling people's creativity. maybe it is just a little too high brow for some. i thought the basic premise was to build a story around some form of internet technology and how it effects people or society on the whole. each episode throughout and especially in s5 does exactly that. what is the problem? good tv can sometimes make you squirm in your seat or make you feel awkward. it challenges your way of thinking. brilliant! i definitely want more.\",\"amazing ! with a few exception episodes, everything was triple aaa\",\"i was really looking forward to this and then i watched episode 1... got about half way through episode 1 before the diversity tick a box exercise was just so over the top it distracted from the story. i understand that the us is going through some kind of identity crisis but don't inflict it on the rest of us. it must be so hard in the us to make a series these days without casting which has no relevance to the story or helps move the story along. but what can you expect from netflix these days. then there are the stories... what a yawn fest and after trying episode 2 just gave up. do yourself a favour and go watch the old series they were so much better!\",\"just finished watching the previous seasons.this is basically what you get when you give creative freedom to a bunch of writers\\u002factors and a 💰 full of money.for those who are still missing out on this gem. watch it for the wow factor and thought-provoking scenarios.beware of extreme violence and nudity tho, it's netflix after all.\",\"what i like about this show is it is totally outside the box!!amazing plots and endings\\nin my opinion it's best sci-fi series!!loved the 3 seasons so far and i have to comment on the amazing graphics and animation 👍👍👍\",\"99% of the people who love this are young males that are into video games. if that's you ... congratulations you will love this. if not you probably won't.the episodes are mostly extremely violent. the show should be called death, violence and violent robots. people who are into video games will love this. the rest of us will not.i did enjoy the animation ... perhaps next time netflix can create an animated anthology for adults that is centered around sex, love & robots ... with no violence.\",\"this is probably the most under-rated show ever! i haven't heard anyone talk about it or the show making any kind of buzz online but i have to say the out of the box ideas and stunning looks of the show and the story telling everthing was just perfect. a few episodes didn't land properly but other than that the show manges to blow your mind in every single episoed. considering most episodes are of 20 minutes only and yet they mange to blow your mind thats just great. i have immense respect for this show!\",\"introduction:\\ni can claim with copious amounts of clear confidence, that there is no show that's anything like \\\"love, death and robots\\\". and it's a show that i absolutely love. while not as good as similar series, such as, \\\"the twilight zone\\\" or \\\"black mirror\\\", 'love, death and robots\\\" is still a respectable series.the stories:\\n\\\"love, death and robots\\\" is an anthology series, that tells the many different stories, that span many different genres: such as, science fiction, fantasy, horror, and comedy. however, this is not a show for everybody, the violence is at an all time high in this anthology, and the same goes for the sex and nudity, just know the first episode will shock you. and while i am usually not the kind of person for self-indulgent gore and sex for the sake of shock value, i think this show knows how to use that technique.every episode feels so different from each other, that by watching just two episodes of the show, it would feel like you're watching two different series. the episodes are all different lengths, one could be twenty minutes, and one could be ten minutes. and while not all the stories hit, the ones that do, really do.from great comedic writing, to great world building, to characters you instantly fall in love with and grow attached to. so here are in my opinion the best episode of the series: my favorites are \\\"three robots\\\", \\\"the witness\\\", \\\"zima blue\\\", \\\"fish night\\\", \\\"sonnie's edge\\\", \\\"beyond the aquila rift\\\", \\\"when the yogurt took over\\\", and \\\"the secret war\\\".the animation:\\nevery episode has a different and unique animation style. which really adds to the originality of the show. it is the hardest thing for me to choose what i think which episode is the best animated. but if i had to choose, i think the best style belongs to \\\"the witness\\\", as it has a sort of comic book style with sound-effect words that pop up on the screen, and resembles \\\"spider-man: into the spider-verse\\\", but in my opinion, the style to this one is better. because some backgrounds and shots of this short, look real. and \\\"the witness\\\" isn't the only one. \\\"good hunting\\\" has a style that resembles a cross between american and japanese styles of animation, something that resembles avatar: the last airbender\\\". and i could ramble on all day about the amazing animation.the characters:\\nthis show is able to create such interesting characters in under twenty minutes. a good example of what i'm talking about is in \\\"zima blue\\\". the main character in that story is a depressed artist, who feels unfulfilled with life. and by the end finds purpose, not in the money and power he processes as a successful artist, but rather doing a simpler job, that doesn't get him nearly as much recognition. and the same goes for most of the other characters in this anthology.conclusion:\\nif you are not a fan of shocking imagery and copious amounts of gore or sex, this show is not for you. but if you can get passed that, and enjoy the interesting stories, well, give it watch. i promise you will love it. it might be a show made for you, but it's a show made for me.\",\"each episode is better than the last. i love that they are short, and using state-of-the-art animation.\",\"i don't care how good your animation is. i don't care how good your texture mapping is, or your pre rendered lighting, or your production design. unless any of it supports a well written story, it's a glorified tech demo.and that's all this show is. it's a bunch of short \\\"films\\\" mimicking things the \\\"filmmakers\\\" have seen before without any concrete understanding of why it worked in the first place.the shorts are made by visual effects artists, not writers. the focus and effort was clearly on the animation wow factor, and less delivering quality content, that people are paying for.i think the episode that finally broke the camels back for me was the episode in season 2 when the giant washes up on the beach:it looked gorgeous; the concept was completely original. then they have a terrible voice actor recite terrible, cliched, pretentious lines of dialogue that add nothing. everything the narrator says can be seen on screen. has this episode been dialogue-less, it would have been near perfect. but these films weren't made by story tellers, they were made by 3d effects artists. so none of them heard of the lesson they teach year one in film school: show, don't tell. and on top of that, the dialogue is the most nonsensical lofty noise i have ever heard; a pretentious british voice actor reciting lines he doesn't understand, but they threw in a bunch of \\\"smart\\\" words, so that means the writing is intelligent, right?really embarrassing. 2\\u002f10 because the animation is very good in all episodes, but none of the episodes themselves are good because the writing is poorer than poor. and i'm reviewing this as a show, not a tech demo. which is clearly is.2\\u002f10.\",\"for starters; the show is an anthology, so it's probably going to be hard to review the show without spoiling, and this review may not be helpful for everyone; since a lot of people seem to like the show but generally for completely different reasons.i'll just say i was put onto this series after my university lecturer recommended it and i'm so glad that she did; it's great.\\npersonally, i liked some episodes more than others, i wasn't particularly a fan of the episodes sonnie's edge, lucky 13, helping hand, beyond the aquila rift, shape-shifters because they all looked the same (i'm a gamer but that doesn't mean i like seeing what is essentially a ps3 cutscene of extensive length, also, some of them look excellent and almost photorealistic or uniquely styled while others look only a few pixels away from being the polar express) and generally those episodes took themselves too seriously for what they were.and while i really loved the aesthetic and design in the witness and i found the ending pretty nice; everything else about it could've used a lot more work.it's a mixed bag, and i can only chastise what i didn't like about certain episodes but many other people really loved aquila rift and sonnie's edge, i just found those 3d ps3 cutscene-looking episodes to be pretty bland and uninspired in design compared to the massive variety from every other episode, that being said: some of them had really good writing and performances and maybe if i watched these episodes in a different order and broke up the unending cutscene for a bit, i'd like those episodes more for the non-aesthetic differences that set them apart.\\nsome people may have also seen certain reviews by film critics that disparaged the show on account of it's treatment of women, and the series itself is supposedly an unofficial continuation of heavy metal (1981) which had a lot of objectification in itself, so some viewers may be apprehensive about watching the series, though i will say that i don't believe those criticisms can be applieed to every episode in the series; so i'll just list the episodes that fit that description:episodes with themes or scenes of sexual assault were sonnie's edge, the witness and good hunting.episodes where women were objectified would include the three listed above, as well as beyond the aquila rift, alternate histories (brief scene), and very slightly in helping hand (features a woman in a singlet and briefs, sort of like how ellen ripley is seen in parts of alien).hopefully i didn't miss any, and hopefully you found this helpful if you wanted to watch the show but avoid those aspects.\\nfans of robert valley's artwork and animation style; i would encourage you to watch the show even if it's just for the episode zima blue, it was a pleasant surprise to see him involved in an episode.all in all though; a very nice anthology, those are hard to pull off, i'm not really a fan of any other anthologies aside from the original twilight zone, but i liked this one too, but for different reasons to the twilight zone.\",\"these are best of science fiction and fantasy short short.stories in tv. some have so much potential that my only regret is they are not made into full feature movies. secret war is my favourite.\",\"the animationi is great the writing is awesome holy s%$# this is the coolest show i've seen i awhile i am speechless its so good\",\"reminds me of some other show, wonder what it is. oh, yeah ! star trek!\",\"if you've ever thought about the world and where it's possibly heading, this is your show. if you've ever thought at all, this is your show. true art of our time.\",\"one of the greatest visual events i have ever seen! every episode is relatable to a game, film or era. just wonderful. thank you so much.\",\"great stories and music. love that all eps are so different yet the same show.the tech advances are essential and just make your mind blow!hated in the nation was great. the bee episode. great twists!!! seen it a few times.san juniper or similar also a very good plot and twist.the ep where the american backpacker goes to the creepy english country house was very good but scary. i could watch with sound. i know i'd have got right out of there. another good twist at the end but made me sad.and fyi he is goldie hawn and kurt russell's son.the ep striking vipers was good and also a thinker of what we could do if we could. the best bros thing was awkward.mickey cyrus ep also good. but the villains didn't get enough karma for me.\",\"this show has everything a netflix binger, or anyone for that matter, could possibly want in a tv series, breathtaking visuals, gritty and superb violence, brilliantly written narrative, and due to each episode being so relatively short there is absolutely no nonsense with this series. i cannot praise this show highly enough. 11\\u002f10\",\"reminds me of the animatrix but on an whole other level. some of the best animation and storytelling i've seen in a long time. the depth and emotion that is achieved in such a short time is incredible. a masterpiece. keep it coming netflix we need more.\",\"i'm giving it a 3 stars because there are a couple stories that weren't so bad but it's like the writers and directors were under the impression that good entertainment means lots of blood, dismemberment and death. there are some really hokey stories as well and i think they knew that so they tried to add in a bunch of gore thinking that would fix poorly put together episodes. it could've been good but i guess the target audience are desensitized 14 year old boys.\",\"to make this clear i don't like watching animated films or shows i'm not a child anymore, i was flicking through netflix this morning and came across love death and robots i watched the trailer and thought this looks good but it's animated what shall i do ignore it or give it a go if i don't like it i can just stop watching it so i just give it a go so i started to watch it wow this netflix series is brilliant i can't stop watching it i could watch this all day everyday and still not get bored of it. because i'm not into animated films or shows i like the shortness of each episode plus it's not made for kids it's an 18 or should be with the swearing, nudity, blood and violence in each episode. it's well written and the animation in some episodes are so excellent they almost seem so real i know they are but from an animation perspective..... it's brilliant what else can i say just keep up the great work and please have many episodes to come thankyou for your great work it's been a great watch thankyou. anybody who isn't into animation like me just give it a go it's a must watch.\",\"so i guess a good script is out of fashion. by the looks of it it seems to be inspired by animatrix, both visually and auditorial, and if not for the horrible script, bad voice acting, the neverending one-liners, unnecessary nudity, it's predictable plots and the constant immature profanities, it could have been good. but it's not. it feels like it's been made by a bunch of teens who wants nothing more than to animate naked women and sex scenes.\",\"unnecessary gore, profanity and nudity. while some episodes like the hitler one are kind of interesting they don't save the overall downright bad quality of the show. too bad all these different animation artstyles are put to waste. what exactly is the point of hyper realistic cgi animation again?\",\"have you ever taken a bite of something, found it yummy and reached for another only to find the plate disappointingly empty?\\nthat pretty much sums up my experience with ld+r.i managed to watch the entire 3 hour run time of this incredible new series in a single sitting, and some of the episodes i even watched twice.while visually amazing with promises of intriguing storylines, much of the writing was rather lacklustre to be honest and as a sci-fi reader i found soem stories to be too predictable.although, trying to think of a suitable analogy, all i could come up with is something from harry potter...it's like berty's all flavoured beans were turned into a sci fi animation series: every episode has its own flavour and everyone will find at least one bean, i mean episode, that will capture their heart or imagination. but in there are just enough soap, slug and snot flavoured beans to make you think before chowing down.i can't put my finger on it, but i guess i loved the idea of the series more than the actual shows themselves. weird, isn't it?---personal ranking of the top eps.zima blue\\nthe witness\\nthree robots\\nlucky 13the rest left me kinda all mehed out.\",\"perhaps one of the most genuine and interesting projects on netflix.an animated anthology whose strength lies in the number of stories, their variety, their animation and above all, their subject matter.about love, death, robots, or all of them together, we can witness an endless number of stories and plots for all tastes.from absurd things like hitler's alternative futures (one of my favorites), to the satire of the 3 robots in a world without humans.but it is not only in the critics where this series stands out: it is very strong in experimental animation like \\\"buena caceria\\\" which is raw and excellent. but it also shines when it comes to lovecraftian creatures, or in philosophical approaches like in \\\"zima blue\\\".this year, secret level came out from amazon prime trying to emulate this success but not reaching these levels.in any case, this is not a perfect series and therefore has a few episodes that are either very boring or just average\\u002fbad. that's why the series' score should be given based on the sum of all its episodes.season 1 146\\u002f18 8.1\\nseason 2 57\\u002f8 7.125\\nseason 3 72\\u002f9 8total score for the series so far: 8.\",\"i like the animations in all episodes either the 2d or the 3d, but there are lots of episodes that i feel they have no beginning, no end, no plot twist, nothing, not that much effort in terms of writing. just a fight with a mythical creature(s) that doesn't end well or a dream in a fantasy world, which is still visually captivating but nothing else.some of the episodes are just \\\"ideas\\\" from short scenes from very well known movies, like \\\"gravity\\\" or \\\"world war z\\\" or \\\"wolverine\\\".very small number of episodes that i really liked as \\\"good hunting\\\" or \\\"mason's rats\\\".i would say the animation and the production are very well done. the writing is not.also the amount of violence, gore and sex is too much, and the warning on netflix at the beginning of the episode says \\\"+18 violence\\\" but doesn't contain anything related to sex or nudity, which seems misleading for me.\",\"20 minutes per episode will blow your mind! i binged watching this show till 3am. 2019s biggest surprise\",\"netflix has created a lot of shows in their time. some are good, some are bad, and others are amazing. i've only watched one episode so far, namely 3 robots, and i can't remember when i laughed so hard.maybe it's just the nerd references that keep flying back and forth. or the absolutely gorgeous animation. or even the voice cast. it's just one of the best things i've seen in a long time.\",\"all the stories feel incomplete, even for a short story, generic, uninspired and generally lacking in substance. all in all, nothing

with their bloated egos and communist muttering is almost over. they know that and so they dump on this sort of thing. they say too violent and too heterosexual. i say bring it on! i have no trouble with animation beating the best dinosaur hollywood has to offer and it is happening. now you can see anything you can imagine. just one warning: don't become like the krell or for that matter the

(roughly). i have liked most of the quibi series so i was used to this style so didn't bother me too much.the story and messaging has to get out there pretty quickly and this show was brilliant so i binged watched a lot of it. each episode is unique and just soooo clever. a few of the stories were relevant to modern day which i loved and also centred around basic human behaviour.my favourite episode is 'sonnie's edge', which is the first episode of season 1, i cannot say enough about this episode and have watched it many times. in fact i want to watch all seasons again.initially the series reminded me of 'black mirror' but it is sharper and more intelligent. love, death and robots just grabs your attention you won't want to stop pressing play for the next one.excellent story lines and animation, can't wait for the next season, aaa+++ from me.\",\"my review rating is based on the average of all episodes. honestly, the better ones outnumber the bad ones. there overall tone of the show reminds me a lot of the animatrix. technology has advanced quite a lot since then and you can see it easily. however technology does not necessary mean good story which is evident in certain episodes. in any case i'm looking forward to the next season. i'm sure there will be new and really pleasant surprises. not sure if many people mentioned it but for me the voice talent they picked is amazing. i recognize some voices from different shows, games from years ago. that's quite something.\\nin conclusion i only wish some episodes were at least 20 minutes longer. i know there's plenty to be told in 10 but it's not worth making rushed conclusions just to fit the timing. there were more bad endings than good just for that reason alone.\\nfavorutes:beyond the aquila rift, zima

(then again, they only make 3 episodes per season!) the material is such an accurate reflection of the time we live in and is so condensed that the stories are hard to shake off for quite some days after viewing. again, very well written. notice, for instance, how amazingly natural the dramatic principle of foreshadowing is applied.\",\"i am reminded that poignant and critical science fiction still holds a place in our society. no matter how advanced our world becomes i hope someone will always be holding a magnifying glass up to the people and technology that shape out daily lives. in the vein of rod serlings twilight zone, black mirror shows us a bleak impression of the future if we succumb to the immediate gratification of technology and cynicism. each black mirror episode is it's own stand alone piece. i'm not going to do a breakdown of the episodes. they are all worth checking out. just trust me when i say it's some of the best sci-fi i've seen in a long, long time. real

with.sometimes it is not clear what it wants to say, there is no meaning to derive...or the problem, practical or ethical , is so far fetched that it doesn't feel realistic!!!\",\"i gave this a watch after reading an article on it. i have never been into cartoon\\u002fanime or manga which this feels like in some episodes so a bit of a gamble from what i would normally watch and wow has that gamble paid off.extraordinary throughout with each episode giving you something to think about afterwards.my favorite was ep 3 the witness which is provoking and unique and left me thinking about it for at least one hour after.the yoghurt takes over in a world where trump is president seems oddly achievable.i would recommend this to anyone and would advise to go in without looking into and without any prejudements and enjoy it for what it is. a well thought out and beautifully produced extraordinary piece of cinema, that you will likely watch over and over again. the imdb rating is highly justified and this is something completely different to anything i have seen in the past.\",\"while the individual episodes are quite good, i will make a guarantee to netflix that if you keep making science fiction\\u002ffantasy short films i will always watch them.\",\"if you want to see here actual review, just skip it and keep scrolling for another one. there is another special case i want to talk about. people i know divided in their opinios oppositely, some consider this series as great, some as awfull. no grayscale here, only black and white. trully unique case, social phenomenon.\\ni had many recommendations to this series from my friends. so, i asked my best friend did he already watched it. he replied positively and added: \\\"it's one of the worst things\\\". i've got to explain here. my friend likes almost everything, many movies he likes for me are the mess, he is not that categorical as i am, so if he tell about something it is bad then there is really something wrong about it. eventually i became so intrigued to watch it by myself (actually i thought if he don't like it, for sure i will).\\nso quick overall. every single episode have that futile story, that feeling i am watching not a professional product but some kind of amateurish work like school project of nine year olds never leaved me. it was really hard for me to get to the last episode. don't know why i accomplished this task, is it was a curosity or a hope next episode will be at least something worthy two stars or more, but all in vain. everything is objectively bad. even technically there is nothing special: cartoon episodes offers nothing fresh or interesting technique, 3d episodes graphically outdated - just look for warcraft iii's (which is more than 15 year old already) movie clips for example.\",\"netflix doesn't stop surprising. after massive failure of classic animation adaptations, they finally got something damn right.let me start with saying, that overall quality is all over the place. it seems that there aren't many common elements. quite few shorts just don't keep up with the tempo that was imposed by first five episodes. clearly there was little to none communication between studios as many stories don't have much to do with anthology's title.if we were to judge book by it's cover it would be solid 9\\u002f10. absolutely stunning variety of styles gives a once-in-a-lifetime trip. unfortunately, only few decided to go beyond looks and serve us narration that is equally engaging. majority looks like impressive tech demo, especially ones using motion capture.it is a bit disappointing, that instead of love, death and robots we get more of immature nudity and primitive exposure as a common theme. although, there are fragments that use it as a part of world-building and that can leave quite an impression (vide the witness, season 1, episode 3).whole anthology is quite a mess in regards to what it's trying to convey. first few animations seem to resonate towards \\\"black mirror\\\" or \\\"the animatrix\\\" in the best way possible. further down though it feels like going to posh, underground restaurant. entering with a promise of wild, crunchy dishes served in complete darkness we realise soon enough, that said meals are half cooked broccoli.regardless how anthology feels as a whole, first few episodes deserve an ovation. and when you finally take a sit after applause you might as well watch till the end. because even though emotions disappear seconds after fade out, during viewing itself it's easy to convince oneself, that veganism is highest form of cooking and broccoli can actually be quite a feast.\",\"if a person were like a male teen, without a moral code, without appreciation for true values, having social adjustment issues, then maybe comments about how well the animation is done are understandable, because the rest of it was so pitiful and dark that it overwhelms any attempt at art here. the medium was well done. the content was so vapid that a rating of 2 was hardly justifiable.\",\"nice visuals and art, but everything else is just unbearable, do not watch if you are over the age of 18 or have a decent attention spam, is waay too edgy, and believes it is much more clever than it actually is\",\"the big difference between s1 and s2 of love death + robots is the amount of episodes. i was a little disappointed when finding there was only 8 instead of the 18 we got in s1 and i think that's why most people are not as pleased and since they aren't as pleased, they are most probably finding the negativity in the episodes and connecting it to the negative feelings they have with the lack of episodes. there for creating a negative experience.but seriously the 8 episodes in s2 are great.all of them are great little stories and sometimes that's all we need, is a snippet into a characters life. and yes that snippet may only go for 5 to 10 minutes. but ld+r isn't about 30-60 minute stories with long drawn out sequences that are just there for filling time.it's actually quite impressive what these directors and writers can make you see and feel within a short period of time.this series is about short creative stories, with impressive and different animations about love, death and robots. s2 is no different to s1.\",\"jaw dropping animation quality. give it 5 more years and we're out of the uncanny valley folks. the amount of micro facial expressions at display and actually hitting home here is insane.\\nthe overall art style used throughout certain shorts really raises the bar and is going to be hard to top. 10\\u002f10as for the writing, sure it's got its share of anti-climaxes, a particular \\\"pay off\\\"-form that's not gonna please everybody. and a deeper message was not always present, other than 'yo look at all this \\\"love, death and\\u002for robots!\\\"'. a simple concept used to engage us into a wild rollercoaster ride of emotions and visuals. 8\\u002f10with influences from anime, games and typical shock value that fuels our social- media-induced-and-short-attention-spanned-society these days, this series is a perfect example of a \\\"fine product of its time\\\". 9\\u002f10 from me\",\"way too many 10\\u002f10 episodes for this not to get a 10.\\neach and everyone a moral dilemma, most a frightening look at how fast tech is growing and how it could ruin life as we know it.\\nlook at us just 10 years ago, and look at this very message about a t.v. show on a streaming site called netflix. where are we going to be as 2030 rolls in.black mirror tounge very much stuck in cheek . and to top it off its written by one of the funniest dry dark comedy guys in britain charlie brooker.\",\"last season was not as expected but miley episode was so much fun idk why people are hating on it. maybe they are jealous or something idk but just the season i am disappointed with the rest its an awesome and must watch series\",\"spectacular stories told in so many different ways. sci-fi dystopias, robots, cats... it's great.\",\"not every episode is a masterpiece but they are all beautiful. it's like scifi heaven. i want to shake netflix's hand for putting this together. i haven't enjoyed this type of thing since the animatrix. it's just wonderful. i can't tell you my favs. i'd have to rewatch them all a few time to separate the good from the brilliant.\\nplease encourage more of this!\",\"black mirror is a phenomenal tv series, but it's also deeply unsettling because it explores themes of brutality and humiliation in especially social media platforms, and often has an eerie invasive feel about it. however much it unsettles, it also challenges, so black mirror is often as repugnant as it is thought-provoking. some episodes do indeed go too far and become expressions of anxiety, paranoia and shame rather than having a take-away. i would give black mirror 9\\u002f10 for that, but on the flip side some episodes can be uniquely transcendent so it is difficult to do that.black mirror tackles ideas of cyber crime and the heartlessness that can happen from behind a screen. it talks about cell phone addiction and other kinds of benign-seeming uses of technology that can open the door to catastrophe when used in the wrong way. in particular black mirror tackles something we might call \\\"outrage culture,\\\" as in the blacklisting of people we don't like. the themes of black mirror often do tie into modern day happenings, such as \\\"canceling\\\" someone like on youtube. the series does give you a lot to think about, especially about the punishment of those who occupy a moral gray area.while not always on its a game, black mirror has many gems, and is remarkably variable in its scope and in its tone. as others say, however, black mirror is hard to binge-watch because it can be unimaginably bleak, and often intentionally so. the series is rather traumatizing and difficult, but often the very bleakness can act as cautionary tales, and help you to be more empathetic and responsible when interacting with people online.i hated black mirror, it was miserable, but also i think the series is better than most because there is a responsibility to it, and i do believe it doesn't try to condone its own blackheartedness. i do appreciate the substance of it.i wouldn't say i love black mirror, because it's terrifying and sometimes disgusting, but i do appreciate it and admire much of its efforts.\",\"some ideas are really nice and some plots are exciting.but sadly a big part of the episodes have a childish comic look like pixar movies. this kills the atmosphere totally and making this episodes totally meaningless.the realistic animated episodes are way better from the look, but often have no really good plot.what remains is a little show if you wanna watch something for 10\\u002f20 minutes without going deep into a plot and universe.\",\"an anthology of science fiction that range from comedy to thriller to sheer horror. these 18 animated shorts go from 7 to 17 minutes in length and are easy to binge. the animation of each of these stories varies in style. some are photo realistic computers animation and others use classic 2d animation. some of the tales ended too abruptly leaving the me wanting more. but i not sure if that's a bad thing. the only ones that fell out of place were fish night, the witness which left me with more questions and the dump whose ending wasn't much of a surprise. and were my only reason for not giving this a full 10 stars. top of the class awards go to the titles shape shifters, lucky 13, three robots, sucker of souls and sonnie's edge. the rest are very good i just like these better. these film shorts are nsfw and definitely not for children due to mature language, full nudity, sexual themes and graphic violence.\",\"well directed, tension builds and builds. however, the whilst the episodes are good but they a definitively nor futuristic, rather they are more current conspiracies. there is no futuristic aspect to the majority of the episodes - no sci-fi aspect. sadly, disappointed.subject matter has the potential to be futuristic, however, the content is more occult\\u002f wolverine. this franchise has lost it's focus, lost it's way. it needs new righters to be keep the franchise as it set out to be: set in the future with innovative twists. currently, this series is so far away from the remit it needs to be called something else. it is not worthy of the esteemed hallmark of a black mirror.\",\"a macabre investigation into the extent that technology can manipulate lives and condition the world people live in; terrifying and personally, absolutely brilliant. episodes like white christmas and uss callister for me are two of the scariest because they present the dangers of replicating human consciousness, which is only one of the foreboding concepts that black mirror warns of. what's also satisfying is the great range that the show spans across its episodes which each offer a unique tale, with subtle easter eggs weaving the anthology together, largely impressive acting and unexpected twists throughout.\",\"... and i'm enjoying every single second of it.\\n introduction for a long time, we, entertainment consumers, have been fed relatively conservative content steadily. for a while, parent guiding certification (pg-13, etc...) had been enough to the majority of mainstream production companies out of ''risky'' markets such as r-rated movies, tv-ma shows and the likes, because the consensus was that they were missing out on full market capitalization with their content ; making movies\\u002ftv for a part of the market was less lucrative than targeting broader range of audiences.  however, today, because of the abundance of media content, we see a market that is split into multiple sub-genres with a loyal following that will often barely venture out it's own personal preferences, if at all ; if one of those sub-genre gets a large enough representation, however niche and unusual it is, content is gonna be produced and producers will capitalize on the market opportunity. \\n \\n what we get is a bunch of ruthless tv shows, like black mirror, like game of thrones, etc... shows specifically engineered to satisfy our own sick desires and to fulfil our most deranged fantasies. the human mind is twisted, and companies like netflix and hbo have understood and capitalized on it. \\n \\nand you know what ? i'm grateful for it ; i came for entertainment and that's exactly what i get\\n  review black mirror, is a built on a bold concept. at it's core, the show takes contemporary concepts and technologies, enhances them and builds realistic, dystopian-societies, set in the near future, around those technologies. it's purpose is to demonstrate that technology and power are not good nor evil. they are simply tools, used as an extension of the wielder's will. any technology can and will be used for creation and\\u002for destruction given the right circumstances. being an anthology series, it gives the show the ability to visit a lot of different worlds and societies. as a sci-fi fan, the opportunity to explore as much individual, unrelated universes as possible, each containing their own set of characters and stories to explore is a feeling that can't be explained. the show can be enjoyed for what it is, an explicit demonstrations of the eventual problems associated with modern day technology through dystopian societies closely resembling our own, misusing enhanced version of the devices we use everyday. in that sense, it plays as an original sci-fi, drama, thriller with a lot of plot twists.\\n \\n however, it can also be enjoyed for what it represents, and that's the best way to enjoy it in my opinion. it's fascinating to see how a lot of the things we take for granted and assume is harmless or to improve society and human condition is merely a perspective, and the show makes a very good job a demonstrating that point ; i've never been more scared of x-factor, facebook and brain electrodes...\\n \\n what's interesting is that even though a lot of these world feel incredibly alien, they still feel somewhat familiar and instinctive, because they are built around how the human race dealt with a concept or technology in the past, leading to such extreme changes in comparison with todays society, even though, they are not set that far appart in time. \\n \\n what's amazing, is that every one of those societies is a possible outcome for our own human race. the problems and dysfunctions at the root of each dystopian societies portrayed in black mirror are based on current issues, and the way we do or do not deal with them will help shape tomorrow's society into what could be an aberration of it's former self, as shown in many episodes of black mirror. i personally enjoyed the lack of a regular cast that appears in every episode. i think that ongoing character development associated with a recurring character in a tv show encourages lazy writing, because they can always change something or add some flash-back to fix an issue with character\\u002fplot. being an anthology series, each episode is a definitive, final version of a story, including it's protagonists. it also plays as a motivator for actors to give good performances, as they only appear in a single episode (for the most part). i was also pleasantly surprised to see a lot of quality, established actors. the best episode of pretty much every season as been the finale, which to me, indicates that the show's producers are in touch with what makes their show successful and good, especially in an anthology series where the finale's appreciation is not influenced by plot cliff-hangers or events that have been built-up for a whole season. this means hey are likely going to be able to replicate their formula for years to come, and that they didn't just get lucky. on top of that, the show's success could attract big name actors as the format of the show is not overwhelming on an actor's calendar this is the tv show i've been wanting for years without knowing it. i've seen so many movies\\u002ftv-shows that presented original, intelligent, ambitious concepts, but ended up compromising what made them special to comply to social conventions. swapping their bold eccentricity, mid movie for sheer, bland normality. thankfully, that time has come to an end we can finally see how alien, twisted, and scary the world could be or have been, with a push in the right direction.\",\"it was an incredible journey...every episode every character was outstanding and magnificent, animation 11\\u002f10 dialogue short but very smart and good,i want more from this series.\",\"you're missing a masterpiece of animation if yoy haven't watched it yet\",\"an anthology series of sorts, where technology and humanity don't always lead to pleasant results. this satirical and usually demented show is great in its technical craftsmanship and usually sharp and witty in its execution. the first episode the national anthem is a great start to this series, about the princess being kidnapped and the prime minister being told he needs to have sex with a pig or she dies. this sounds lowbrow, but it's pulled off with a straight face and in lesser hands this would have been written into a corner - but the ending simply works. 8\\u002f10the second episode fifteen million merits is perhaps the best of the series, about a society that peddles stationary bikes to generate power and the individual earns points to purchase products or a chance to appear on a contestant show. the idea is thoughtfully explored, there's a quick budding romance that's wonderfully done and the episode goes into some dark places. this is a great piece of science fiction. 9\\u002f10the third episode the entire history of you explores the trivial bits of nonsense we obsess about, when everyone has recorders implanted in the back of our heads and you have the ability to record and playback any time, anywhere. what begins with our lead going through his job interview and replaying one phrase that could be interpreted in any way, over and over - leads to an obsession about the possibility of his wife having an affair. the segment is well acted and the use of the technology feels entirely believable. 7\\u002f10the second season didn't engage me - sometimes at all. the first episode be right back, felt too cold and distant and felt empty and pointless by the end. 5\\u002f10the second episode white bear hinged on a twist gimmick that was both a strength and a weakness. the twist works as an idea, but sours everything before it and both the twist and the preceding events felt half baked. didn't deliver. 4\\u002f10the third episode the waldo moment, about a depressed comedian voicing a crude animated character that ends up being used as a political puppet to disrupt an election is successful enough. but like all the episodes this season, the sharp wit and beautifully thought out visuals are missing. 6\\u002f10the white christmas special plays up the anthology format for the first time, as two men in a mysterious outpost kill time on christmas by telling their stories that led them to this point in their life at this outpost. the three stories are all engaging and the use of the technology feels remarkably real and the results are haunting and twisted in its humor and drama. a great return to form. 7\\u002f10\",\"whatever you say about this series will be a bit. all the episodes are amazing.you need some time to understand that it's animation and not regular actors.amazing job.\\nseeing the david fincher as producer of the series, you feel confident that something good has been created.\\nthe future of cinema?maybe...\",\"theres such a big market for adult animation. its so very seldomly well done , but this is one of the good ones. i love the quality of the animation , the twilight zone type stories. i hope they get longer, maybe a standard 15 minutes to 30! but i like the versatility. its one of my favorite animated series now. i cant wait for more seasons filled with more episodes. keep up the great work!adult animation rocks!\",\"been a while since anything this clever and create has come out. i've rewatched twice now.\",\"this series impressed me so much that i felt the need to write a review, albeit short. the animation, the direction, the storylines in

story that i wish there was a whole 5 season story around. there was obviously episodes i like more then others but even the ones that's i liked less then others i'd still be watching over and

there is none or that the great moments just out shine the downfalls to the point of me not paying attention to them. either way it is a absolute favorite. and something i have rewatched every month or two and enjoy just as much as the time before.\",\"the slow burn of the last fifteen years has generally seen a decline into the mindless, passionless, and outright stupid fall of great visual

hard\\\".\\nif the rest of the series is anything like the first two episode and i'm almost certain it is, since these impressions indicate something fundamentally wrong with the series direction, then it's a solid 2\\u002f10 (for graphics and animations).\",\"know what episodes to avoid and this is the best single-episode show of all time.\",\"18 standalone episodes. some of them were too

well\",\"i wanna say thank you to make this kind of series which shows us the real things happening in our world and with our humanity. this series made me to think deeply about the world, about the people we are living with, about me and our humanity. the quality of human being is going down... i heard human beings were the animals (monkey i guess)and now i think human beings are again becoming animals. or may be we are keeping update us (human beings and the world) and something going wrong with this updates.. we need to thing about this and we must do something.\",\"only thing i should to say is it perfect, and i still stay for 3rd season. this series inspired for her movie and shown our feature life. black mirror is a british television anthology series created by charlie brooker that shows the dark side of life and technology. the series is produced by zeppotron for endemol. regarding the programe's content and structure, brooker noted, \\\"each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality. but they're all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy. on 9 january 2014, charlie brooker announced the third series of the show, confirming at least two more episodes\",\"one of the most innovative and exciting series i have ever seen.\\na masterpiece from beginning to end!\",\"i went in not really knowing what this was about , i was so amazingly surprised how much i feel in love with it. the stories are great and the graphics are even better . absolutely watch this ! watch it asap!\",\"black mirror is a series of episodes that are not related to one another except for the fact that each of them deals with some aspect of how technology is able to shape human life.reviewing this series would be like trying to review all nature programs. some are about insects, others might be about outer space. the only common theme is the natural world.some of these episodes leave you full of hope for what will be possible in our lifetimes. most of them leave you worried. although i would say that overall they paint a bleak picture of what's coming, they would best be viewed as a reminder that we humans often fail to anticipate the ultimate consequence of our actions and discoveries. they show us that we can find ourselves in situations where we as a species walked inexorably into our own doom, unable to stop our march.such instances have already occurred in history, an example thereof would be the development of nuclear weapons. although their existence is a threat to human life, it seems that for the time being we are unable to get rid of them. think about it. they are not a virus, we have the capacity to destroy them, but our current political standpoint makes it hard for it to happen. fussing with human genome has so far been avoided, but we have the technology and we only need one country to open this pandora box. same thing with ai. it seems that there is no way to stop the advances in ai, as it is advantageous for every country to invest in it, and countries that don't will be left behind. i don't think we have the capacity to even make a pause and think a bit, because there would certainly be someone else pursuing it, so we all walk inevitably to the further development of an evermore capable computer intelligence.we live in a world where it is impossible for each of us to see the bigger picture as the specialization we are subjected too only allows us to be experts in a tiny area of knowledge, and this series alerts us to the possibility of unimaginable pain that we are going to be able to inflict on ourselves in a future that we will be able to see during our lifetimes.\",\"i like black mirror because it is a thought-provoking and challenging show that explores the dark side of technology. the show's anthology format allows it to tackle a wide range of topics, from social media addiction to government surveillance to the dangers of artificial intelligence. each episode is a self-contained story that leaves you thinking about the implications of the technology it presents.i also appreciate the show's dark humor. even though the subject matter is often disturbing, black mirror finds ways to make you laugh at the same time. this helps to make the show more accessible and engaging, and it also serves to underscore the show's message that technology can be both a blessing and a curse.here are some specific episodes of black mirror that i enjoyed:\\\"the entire history of you\\\" (season 1, episode 3): this episode explores the dangers of memory implants and how they can be used to control people.\\\"white bear\\\" (season 2, episode 2): this episode is a disturbing look at the nature of punishment and how it can be used to manipulate people.\\\"san junipero\\\" (season 3, episode 4): this episode is a more hopeful look at the future of technology, as it explores the possibility of creating a virtual afterlife.if you're looking for a show that will make you think, i highly recommend black mirror. it's not for the faint of heart, but it's definitely worth watching.\",\"most episodes are too short to even say something, they just try really hard to blow your mind. some have absolutely no connection with the title with death. some animations ore ok, some other are really liveless. i really liked some episodes but in the big picture they're not enough. in conclusion: great idea, bad execution. i'm hoping there will be a more focused, more challenging season 2 to see this series true potential.\",\"in the space of animated fantasy, anything is possible. in this hyper-masculine dark fantasy world, the use of female bodies for soft porn sex and abusive violence are front and center, starting right off in the very first episode, and in many thereafter. if you're enjoying the lush and charged visual aesthetics, i can understand that, because it's really well designed. dark fantasy can be compelling and charged, and there's definitely a satisfying place for that in the human psyche.what i'd ask you to think about is how this show quite literally uses virtual (3d animation models) women's bodies in all the ways that hard porn does. it grabs on and glorifies all of the \\\"male gaze\\\" stereotypes that are clearly nsf soft porn. the majority of hetero male porn reflects the more toxic aspects of the insecure male issues with power and control over women. those insecure males need to push it onto and into female bodies, treating those bodies like objects and containers used for service. it's applied in isolated, fantasy spaces in order to support the psychological manifestation of power that converts to physical and mental pleasure. 'love, death & robots' adheres and reinforces this toxic male perspective so frequently that it becomes a significant part of the project, and this is a problem. netflix and the show's producers, writers, directors, designers, modellers, texture artists, riggers, storyboard artists and animators are all making choices about how to keep perpetuating porn standards for females.\",\"incredible short stories, well done and no topic is untouchable. love this series, thank you netflix for something truly original.\",\"it's been a while since i sat staring at the screen in awe after watching a series or movie on netflix (or tv for that matter). i did when i watched the first few episodes of love, death & robots on netflix. a nice plot twist, that was also well executed made me say \\\"wow!\\\" out loud.the plots are nice and good in almost all of these short stories. the art style is suburb and direction and cutting is top notch. i like the voice acting and the way characters are displayed and developed, even in the short time the individual series have (10 to 15 minutes).the only negative, perhaps, is the amount of gore. sometimes this is a tad too much for my taste, but after the first few episodes i knew what to expect. but it's still something to be prepared for if you start watching these.recommended!\",\"i honestly want more. pretty much all of them were cool and interesting. the only two that were dumb was the alternative history episode and the paradox murder episode. otherwise it was great to watch\",\"every episode is suprising and makes you feel small when the clue has been released during the time you are watching it as you think: this is not totally unreal.... it could be true....one of my favorite!\",\"in the early to mid 1990's, mtv was one of the few avenues in western society that someone could find visual media that went against the grain; not \\\"edgy\\\" so to speak (ok, some were way too edgy), but more hardcore and explicit than any other television network at the time. the internet was a niche form of technology at this time and, besides vhs tape buying and trading, network and cable tv were the only way to watch visual media outside of movie theaters.liquid television was a half-hour block of short animations done by various artists that ran from 1991-1994. it was the breeding grounds for numerous shows that would go on to be cult classics such as aeon flux, the head, and the maxx. it was also where the first episode of beavis and butthead aired, a series that would become one of the most successful animated franchises of all time.as the 90's went on, numerous animated shows such as south park, king of the hill, and many others could trace their roots to the counter-culture animations, puppet shows, and other crazy shorts that graced american screens through liquid television. it wasn't all great though; i've gone back to watch some of these and think to myself \\\"how the hell did i or anyone find this amusing or funny when it came out?\\\". there was a good deal of crap to sift through to find some of the gems (joe normal still makes me laugh today).with the advent of broadband internet in the mid 2000's, youtube provided an outlet that was tailored for the type of media on liquid television. i was surprised and excited to hear that love, death & robots had a very liquid television feel to it and that a show like this was being made for the massive netflix audience. i was also happy to hear that all of the shorts had the benefit of decent budgets in their creation. the liquid television shorts were usually done on a shoe-string budget and had a raw-animated style to them with many relying on their writing to get their point across.love death and robots is amazing. it captures

incredible... magical.\",\"black mirror is an anthology series that taps into our collective unease with the modern world, with each stand-alone episode a sharp, suspenseful tale exploring themes of contemporary techno-paranoia. the problem however, is that on some of the episodes, the writers desire to invocate twisted endings that convolute what starts out as a suspenseful tale, falls flat to any possible logic that would leave the viewer satisfied. still, most of the episodes do succeed with a satisfying ending. 8\\u002f10 from me\",\"this is my first imdb review, but for this i had to do

and they all play well. everything is done at an excellent level.of course, each series with different stories and directing can not just be for everyone, so something will look uninteresting.the

but natural talented faces... some ideas in this artwork could be disturb you, but this makes it consummate. it questions your life, routines, choices you made, the basic code of ethics you have... at the end, you only feel the happiness of awareness. thank you for showing me something different than usual, thank you for make me more aware.\",\"simply great. every history leaves you with something

laugh in the right places. a laugh structure dependent on the punchline being a nihilistic, redemption free narrative, that we're supposed to already support, because we're part of the cool crowd.if

since the first season, of course (the mixed nature of the episodes). but the premise - a dark reflection of reality, hence the name is now all but absent from the show. and absent this unique spin on

whole lot of r-rated soft porn - yes, you have to suspend a whole lot of your critical thinking to let this play out. danny is married and boinking wife theo for a kid but his torrid albeit confusing affair with karl's avatar in \\\"striking vipers x\\\" is adversely affecting those efforts. she suspects something but he's committed to the lie till he can't, then just forget the ending because

build self-esteem and confidence. once the full potential of the little droid is realized though, it unleashes the full, profanity-laden personality of ashley o. there's another tech element to this but it's not worth describing since the whole episode is marred by three things: first, its target demo is tween girls and guess who doesn't watch \\\"black mirror\\\" at all? yeh, tween girls. second, miley cyrus as pop star plays more to her fantasy than ours, and her voicing the \\\"ashley too\\\" bot is so raw and without any voice-over talent, it just sounds like her

dance, white christmas and hang the dj. i love that they are all independent and different themed episodes. of course, if you dont like weird things you will find this show quite disturbing because it is very explicit. for those who like weird, enjoy!!!\",\"you would think adding cursing would give more freedom to be expressive. but you can't curse just to curse. there has a point to it.and

is on another level. that's saying something, considering the expectation we have now. black mirror is an anthology series that, if you follow dope stuff, has achieved that rare-air status that if

different animation style, from photorealistic, to more abstract and toony techniques. it is a show for your eyes. some stories are more action based, others are more on the philosophical side and criticize modern society, reminding a little bit \\\"black mirror\\\", while other are simply funny. there are some episodes that are very difficult to understand, even if you watch them multiple times. i have debated for hours with my friends about the real meaning of many of these chapters. this is a show that manage to involve you and make you pay attention. there are no narrative wastes, with useless details, the short runtime formula, works perfectly and you can easily watch five or six installments on a row, without even noticing.i have however some small complaints: most of these stories are set on a post apocalyctic and dystopian worlds, which is a setting that i really love, but i would like to have more variety on locations and concepts. some of these episodes are aesthetic over content, an excercise of style, with no plot at all, which is a little bit pointless. for the rest, i have to say that i am very pleased that netlix released a series like this one. if you are into animation, this is something that you need to watch. one of the few show worth to spend time on, in this ocean of garbage that is produced nowadays.\",\"this needed to be done and i am so grateful. i live everything about it. while every so gle story didn't resonate , there are so many moments in the whole that took this series over the top.\",\"this is one amazing show.episode 1 - sonníe´s edge & shape shifter were amazing(the latter had me almost in tears).but all episodes were magnificent. this is a must watch.just speechless.\",\"\\\"love, death, + robots\\\" features stellar animation in all of it's episodes and features stories that are nicely resolved in a quick time frame. when this show is good it is amazing, with some of the most beautiful animation and imaginative stories. episodes like \\\"zima blue\\\" and \\\"pop squad\\\" stand out as fantastic through the expressive animation and bold storytelling. but then there are some episodes that leave a bad taste in my mouth. episodes such as \\\"the junkyard\\\" and \\\"the witness\\\" lack proper stories and follow very annoying and unlikeable characters. then there are the over sexualized shots and scenes featuring characters that only serve the purpose of being eye candy. it usually doesn't work and can be very gross and disturbing. but once you can look past these episodes you will be met with a stupendous show filled with heart, amazing animation, and great stories.\",\"now this is a anthology of short films of the highest caliber. astonishing and beautiful animations and art styles of all different kinds. you don't need to know more - just check it out! be warned though, many are violent and contain nudity so be sure to keep the kids far, far away!\",\"series of short movies from different people and with unique stories. from pool machines, aliens, robots and more! yes we have a xbox 3000 (best version of xbox).\",\"this is my first review of a movie\\u002fseries

nudity, monsters\\u002faliens and other weird stuff with no logic whatsoever which i wish i wouldn't watch.although the yogurt episode seemed fun.i wouldn't recommend to watch this \\\"amazing\\\" series at all, better go watch something good from real life or save your time to enjoy other stuff.e7after watching this i'm feeling confused and shocked. there is no benefit in watching this, no inspiration, no mood boost, not a single good and useful thought to get from this series.1 for the graphics, typography, intros, animations. those are great. enjoyed.\",\"this is something completely different, completely new but still so watchable... genious!\",\"loved this - probably the best thing i have watched on netflix to date. beautiful animation.\",\"14 of the 19 episodes so far have been brilliant, in my opinion. it is a british high tech version of the twilight zone of the early 60's.\",\"i think we'll all agree that this is not black mirror. at least it's not what it used to be.there's nothing wrong with change from season to season, to a certain extent but what they did here was made a completely different series using the name of black mirror.if you are expecting to get your mind blown by the darkest side of crazy technological advances and its effects on people's lives, etc, you are going to be extremely disappointed. there's a little bit of that in the first couple of episodes (still very very light compared to previous seasons) but most episodes are more like short horror movies, and they remind me a lot of inside no. 9 which i'm sure they've taken some inspiration from. where 99% of the action and twists happen in the last 1% of the episode.conclusion: it is well done and definitely worth watching if you like horror and dark humor but it is just way too different to deserve to be called black mirror anymore.\",\"usually, i try to keep away from dystopias because i can't bear their gloominess and pessimism. when i started watching black mirror i only knew that it's a criticism of modern society. but i didn't expect to see that shocking, dark, disturbing depiction of a very near future. but once started watching i couldn't stop. i watched and wondered which dark tale i would see next.i absolutely adore british tv shows, they are a gripping and unique blend of comedy and drama, and distinguished english humor is always a ray of light even in the most tragic circumstances.black mirror is not like that. no humor. no ray of light. only shocking truth.in the majority of the science-fiction films the future technologies are just a part of the society and it isn't shown how they affect our lives on minor levels. well, black mirror shows it like no other film or show. it shows how new gadgets, technologies, social media and entertainment industry imperceptibly slowly and steadily change our perception, change worlds (waldo's moment), societies (national anthem, white bear, 15 million merits), life of individuals (the entire history of you, be right back.)each episode deserves a separate review, separate kudos, but i'll express my thoughts shortly on each of them here:1. the national anthem - the first and the best episode for me. i'm totally freaked out by it. by a society that gathered to watch the most humiliating act forced over an individual. if only a few people from this mob have refused to watch it they could have prevented it. but they haven't.2.15 million merits - unlike other episodes, which describe life and situations, in which we can easily imagine and find ourselves in today or tomorrow, this episode is entirely futuristic. it contains an exaggerated image of modern society: unified people with unified lives zombified by tv. sometimes in this world appears something real, something beautiful, something innocent. then it's broken. sometimes somebody resists. then they are sharply made the part of the system again.3. the entire history of you - basically it's a family drama. the future technology from this episode can be useful for people with bad memory, and can turn into in evil by creeps, who like to think about their past relationships. the evil in this episode is also that with the help of this technology main character humiliates his wife in a way that no one has right to do because everybody has a right to privacy, even spouses.4. be right back - we see a beautiful girl martha who resists the influence of modern gadgets and social media, but eventually, ends up dating a software.5. white bear - a society must have a code. if there are crimes there must be punishment. but even a death penalty and lynch law are more civilized and merciful than that what we have here. the law can't be sadistic and entertaining. otherwise, it's not a law, it's a crime.6. waldo's moment - do you want to be ruled by a cartoon that stands for nothing, thinks nothing, offers no decisions, only farts, insults and makes jokes about its d..k? well, they want.to conclude, if you want to broaden your horizons, watch british tv shows.\",\"black mirror has always been a gripping anthology series that explored the dark side of technology and its impact on society. with its clever storytelling and thought-provoking themes, it became a staple for fans craving dystopian tales that held a mirror up to our own world. however, season 6 left me perplexed and disappointed, as it seemed to deviate from the very essence of what made black mirror so special.the episodes in this latest season seemed to lose their focus on the technological aspect that defined the series. instead, they veered into more supernatural and abstract territories that left me scratching my head. while experimentation can be commendable, it should still stay true to the core identity of the show. i struggled to understand how some of these episodes related to the central theme of technology's impact on society. the lack of a clear connection was jarring and left me feeling disconnected from the narrative.moreover, the episodes lacked the biting social commentary that was once a hallmark of black mirror. previous seasons masterfully critiqued our reliance on technology, our obsession with social media, and the potential dangers of unchecked scientific advancements. in contrast, season 6 seemed more interested in exploring philosophical musings and metaphysical concepts. while these ideas can be intriguing in their own right, they didn't feel like they belonged in the black mirror universe.as a longtime fan, i found myself yearning for the clever twists and shocking revelations that made the earlier seasons so memorable. the writing, while still competent, failed to deliver the same impact and left me longing for the intellectual depth that was once a trademark of the show. the stories lacked the punch and resonance that kept me on the edge of my seat in previous seasons.while i appreciate the creators' willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas, i can't help but feel that season 6 strayed too far from the original black mirror formula. it feels like a missed opportunity to further explore the chilling consequences of technology in our lives. as a result, i'm reluctantly lowering my initial rating for this season. i hope that future seasons can recapture the essence of what made black mirror so captivating in the first place.overall, season 6 of black mirror left me perplexed and unsatisfied. it deviated from the show's main concept and failed to provide the gripping narratives and societal critique that fans have come to expect. here's hoping that the next season will be a return to form for this once groundbreaking series.\",\"'black mirror' is, in my opinion, a standalone in what it achieves. by exploring the dark side of futuristic technologies it really delves into the uncertainty and fear surrounding technological advancement and the fragility of the human mind. it poses the audience with very real and very relevant questions about where we are and where we're going and whether the progress we're making is truly progress at all. being an anthology series means that each episode of 'black mirror' offers a new and unique experience and story, whilst maintaining the common theme of technological advances. it's exciting because with each new episode you just don't know what you're going to get since they're often written and directed by a different team of people. luckily, each episode and season benefits from an incredibly strong cast of talented actors that bring to life very real and interesting characters. however, the anthology organisation of the show is a negative as much as it is a positive, since each episode is very hit or miss. there are some episodes that are truly dreadful and that fall completely flat, whilst there are others that are brilliant masterpieces. which ones are good vs which are bad, will all comes down to individual tastes but personally my favourites are, the entire history of you, nosedive, shut up and dance, hang the dj, san junipero, playtest, black museum and white christmas. each episode, whether you enjoy it or not, will leave its mark and is very representative of very real issues that we're debating today. is it right to unnaturally preserve human life? is it right to monitor your child's every move? is it right to exploit technology to exact our own justice or revenge? is it right to create unnatural technologies that defy nature and pose a danger to everyone that uses them? it's these kind of thought provoking and emotive moral dilemmas that 'black mirror' tackles with each episode and what makes it so brilliant.\",\"it's like someone took deviant art and placed it into an animated series. worth watching all the freaking way!\",\"this series is absolutely disgusting! i don't understand how anyone can watch this.\",\"tim miller, the chromatic brilliance machine behind deadpool and mnemonic difference engine of cinema,

society. definitely a must watch, but be sure to let each story settle in and digest. my favorite episodes are \\\"the national anthem\\\", \\\"be right back\\\", \\\"playtest\\\", \\\"metalhead\\\" and \\\"smithereens\\\". i did enjoy the latest season, but felt it lacked some of the pop previous seasons had.\\\"loch henry\\\" had to my pick of the season, as it explored how well do you know your family and community. there were also sudden undertones about how tragedy can be exploited for one's own personal gain.\",\"each one of these short masterpieces is thought-provoking. by turns hilarious, tense, poignant and transcendent, each episode is perfectly realised and just as long as it needs to be. and yet most contain the potential for an hour-long or even feature-length treatment. the result is that we get intense espresso shots of invention. some of these will haunt you.\",\"i haven't finished the season yet, only about 5 episodes in but just had to come here to rave about this show! each episode is only between 5 and 10 minutes or so but each one takes you on a crazy ride which sometimes makes you wish lasted longer just so you can see more of the world.the art is phenomenal as well as the musical score. the writing is witty, interesting, funny, emotional and just a giant rollercoaster of emotions. some episodes are funny, some sad and some just messed up and full of adrenaline. i also particularly like how each episode has a different art style. one had real actors, one was all cartoon, another was like a mixture of cgi\\u002fcartoons over real video (i think.. it looked way too real to not be... think waking life for the style!).each episode so far seems to have something to do with technology whether it be a futuristic dystopian setting, robots, vr, etc... it all has to do with technology (even if it's sometimes very subtle). i saw another article that stated people are comparing this show to black mirror but more intense. i could definitely see where they would get that. it does have the whole black mirror vibe and it is an anthology series.definitely give this show a go. watch a few episodes. if you don't like it after 2 or 3 it probably isn't for you.\",\"black mirror is a reality check. it is not a feel-good show, but manages to redeem its perturbing quality with its penetrating insight and indictment of mainstream society. it's m.o. is poignantly portraying and exploring the role technology is playing in our present through a series of futuristic, somewhat hyperbolized sci-fi scenarios where society has arguably mal-adapted to technological advance. the thing is despite the futuristic setting, the show resonates intensely with the now, i guess, as good sci-fi should do. a sample of themes from season one:-how absurdity, grotesqueness, and even violence have been trivialized to the extent of becoming entertainment at times. how trauma, depicted so readily on screens these days, has become something to watch primarily for stimulation. how, in many ways, we've become sadistic spectators or at best desensitized unconcerned bystanders. -how a system that commodifies human life and energy (particularly lower and middle- class human life and energy) i.e. \\\"a dead-end job\\\" is maintained by aloof sociopathic elites through the brainwashes of materialism, distraction, and dream- selling. and how society is complicit in this basically by being satisfied with the comfort of minimal needs being met, no matter how vapid and mundane this renders their life. -how perfect memory, its storage, and recollection can be a double-edged sword. in a society where everyone has a brain implant that records and stores all audiovisual aspects of an individual experience for playback (and projection for all to see) at any moment, what issues will arise? how would you use it? to what extent would you relive your pains, your pleasures? to what extent would you fact-check your friends, family members, and lovers? to what extent would you chase clarity on events that happened outside of your experience, since you know an accessible recording exists in another person? the subsequent seasons continue to tackle various heady and humane issues connected in some way with advanced technology (e.g. hacking, terrorism, virtual\\u002faugmented reality, racism, social media addiction, manipulated consciousness). every episode is its own mental trip, has a twist, and most leave you with a sense of psychological vertigo. this probably isn't a show you want to binge-watch because, again, it isn't a feel good show due to its existential tone (even though it has some truly funny parts and scattered gems in the dialogue). but it is a show that engrosses your mind and gut, and compels you to watch every episode. i like to think this show is like medicine: sometimes hard to palate, but necessary. i took off a star only because some of the endings frustrate far more than they satisfy which, all considered, might be the point. great show. highly recommend.\",\"probably the best of netflix to be released this year and these 18 short stories with an amazing animation effects and brilliance in story concept is an eye-catcher. except for couple of episodes, the other were brutal, fascinating as well as backed by brilliant writing. this is a must watch, even though it may be highly explicit and filled with nudity.\",\"very entertaining series, surprised me, makes up for every minute, very well produced and with very amazing animation effects. the only observation is regarding the \\\"age\\\" allowed, +18.\",\"is it possible that a show can be every emotion ever felt by a human being all at once? well, black mirror definitely proves so. one of the most impressive series of the recent times, it becomes with a strong mix of stories. the creators have obviously spent a lot of time curating these stories to make for thrilling seasons one after the other. i am particularly happy and satisfied with the consistency of the episodes. i love how each one of them (and the directors are to be credited for that, of course) can simply engulf you and make you a part of the story within just a few mins. at several occasions, i have found myself so connected to the characters. the production value is also excellent. you do really start believing what you see because everything looks so convincing. i do hope that this series does not stop for a long long long time!\",\"from the opening shots in episode one you can tell this is a stylish yet very different take on television. the ideas and issues raised by black mirror make for a very intelligent viewing experience. the show tackles the implications and changes in human behavior related to the rise of new technology and media, it definitely lingers with you long after the closing credits. i have never seen anything similar. each season contains only three episodes but this is a very real case of quality over quantity. i cant recommend this enough, if you haven't seen any work from creator charlie brooker you are in for a real treat. i look forward too see what ideas are install for the remaining episodes. my advise to a new viewer to the show would be the less you know going into it the better just sit back and enjoy the ride.\",\"a new anthology series by the ever experimental netflix love, death, & robots explores different genres of mainly scifi & fantasy with interesting stories & characters with the intensity cranked up to 110% definitely nsfw very graphic, possibly not for anyone that doesn't like over the top violence but not all episodes are gory. but it's a definite show to check out from werewolf soldiers to sentient yogurt there's something for everyone.\",\"this was a great let down. i watched this season with my roommates just now and we had so much hype for this. damn... a moment of silence......................................................\\n................................................................\\n......................\\n........................................................................................\\n......................\\n.....................................................................................\\n.................\\n......................\",\"this series is a collection of individual stories so giving it a rating is kind of an average of all of the episodes. the majority of them were outstanding. quality writing and acting and great stories that were inventive and i was honestly glued to the screen for several of them. out of the five seasons that i watched, there are a few duds but none are as bad as netflix's new sci-fi series \\\"another life\\\". that's the worst show i've ever seen.\",\"the storyline of the recent seasons of black mirror falls short of the thought-provoking narratives that characterized its earlier seasons, particularly during its run on channel 4. the show, which once delved deep into themes exploring reality, government influence, and the power of technology and pharmaceutical corporations, seems to have been stripped of its original essence.with netflix at the helm, the show appears to have lost its ability to challenge viewers and question the narratives dictated by those in power. instead, the focus seems to be solely on generating shock value within each individual story, without truly delving into the implications and reflections of our own reality.while season 6 did show some improvement in terms of storyline, it failed to capture the same captivating essence that season 1 and 2 brought to the table under channel 4. those earlier episodes had a remarkable ability to ignite conversations among friends and family, leaving an indelible impact that urged us to contemplate the world we live in.it is disheartening to witness the influence of a nanny corporate state on a show like black mirror. one could argue that this very shift reflects the artistry of the series itself, mirroring the erosion of personal freedoms and our diminished capacity to question the actions of the elite in our own reality.in the current climate, where genuine thought-provoking content is often compromised, it is a lamentable sign of the times. black mirror, once a beacon of intellectual stimulation, seems to have lost its way in the pursuit of sensationalism, forsaking the vital role it once played in allowing viewers to question and challenge the status quo.\",\"i loved it and tbh i don't know why most of the episodes are so low-rated, maybe there was a trend about the show i didn't know about but for me most of the episodes are at least 8\\u002f10. maybe 1 or 2 episodes with 7 or 6 but what i see isn't fair rating!\",\"there's a few episodes that i don't enjoy as much, but they are few and far between. this is an incredible series, with consistent high production value. the storylines are gripping and unique. there's a lot of violence and bleakness, but in a way that feels true to human nature.alberto mielgo's episodes are my favourite offerings on the show. he made \\\"the witness\\\" in season 1, and \\\"jibaro\\\" in season 3.he was the original director for spider-man: into the spider-verse, and everything i loved most about that movie was his brain baby and shines again in the witness and jibaro. he has a confident looseness in his character creation style that's just mesmerising.if you want to check out only one of these series of shorts, i recommend checking out jibaro.\",\"no content\",\"this show has lots of variety, every episode tells an interesting story some episodes are better then others but still i was intrigued my every episode, some ppl on here hated it but there's more ppl that liked this show then ppl that hated it so\",\"lazy writing, to simple and the sex and gore isn't adding anything. the taste of homor is also poor in my opinion.\\nbut the technique they uses to make this is incredible. its very neat and very smooth. but i have to give it a 4 because writing is one of the cores for a good film or serie but it isn't adding anything.\",\"i just can't get enough of it. absolutely loved it. every episode is different that's why i never got bored of it. i'm in just awe of animation and production design. i'm so glad i didn't skip this show. there are definitely some episodes where i couldn't find any meaning behind it and left me in confusion but it's all worth it. one of the most innovative show of all time. there are some stories which are so creative and thought-provoking. shout out to all the animators, writers, directors who put all their efforts to make this possible. i never thought of that some of animations in this show is even possible. it really showed the potential of cinema and the animation. incredible!\",\"i cannot recall any viewing experience as consistently and as constantly as interestijng or exciting as this feast for the eyes. each story is told in a unique style. storylines vary widely. presentations are perfect. i watched it all in one sitting. omg! what a great visual trip!please make more of these. plesse!\",\"one of the best tv series which has complete new story in every episode. all episodes ends with an open ending which is the best part of the series.\",\"i was blown away by the fact that this is a series of stories set in the future, most having to do with robotics, and the stories they tell are so rich in entertaining! i loved this series!!! the only reason i knocked the value down was, *parents watch these episodes first *!!! there were so many family friendly episodes, and then boom!!! an episode that i would definitely class as rated x! that makes zero sense to include those in the same type of video compilation! this was such an excellent movie until then! even the great segments after, were tainted because of the awful videos.\",\"netflix - every year begins to amaze more and more for the better! promoting your projects as future ones that haven't even come out yet and how those who already capture the hearts of many fans! so back to the show \\\"love, death and robots\\\"\\\"love, death and robots\\\" is a series with short series and each with its own plot. this is a huge plus, because no one has done this before. each series has its own genre: this is both horror and fantasy, comedy and action, adventure with fantasy elements or in one of the series you will find - it's all together!i will try now to list you a few pros and cons that i saw in this series:let's start with the pros:1) top quality drawing2) the soundtrack is also at the highest level, the music is generally well chosen for each series, which helps to transfer to that small short film world that we are shown.3) each episode has some small meaning.there are many advantages of this series and i am sure that they will each have their own as well as minuses about which i will also write now1) very short if you even stretch the pleasure of viewing, then it will be enough for 2 evening views2) not all the series are as bright as it seems at first glance, when you review 2 times already, it seems that this series is very unsuccessful, for example, the last but one series for me remained some kind of a fly in the ointment, it feels like it was painted under the drugs, it seems to be a good idea, and the drawing style can be called copyright, but the authors smoked when they were painted by no one knowsif you sum up, then you ask yourself whether it is worth advising someone to watch this series. definitely worth it, even the most worth reviewing it, perhaps more than once, if not to consider something new for yourself, then just to get pleasure from viewing in a good company at home, or alone10 out of 10enjoy watching!p.s. this is my opinion, which has the right to life! if you ask what series i liked and i will recommend to watch that 1 4 7 8 13 series sunk into my soul more than others\",\"created an account to leave this review. i skipped over this show a few times because i'm not into animation type movies, until i came here and read the reviews. glad i watched it because i was hooked from the first episode and wish there was 20 more. it has a real black mirror vibe mixed with the matrix, interstellar, and kill bill to it. each episode stands on its own and isn't related to another, so you can start anywhere; but you'll being desperately wanting more. even though these are short films, the amount of detail and story isn't lacking. the animation is also superb, hitting almost every style; from hyper realism, to anime, to disney-esq. the brilliance is the story telling and what's truly mind blowing. definitely worth watching more than once.\",\"the same people who are mad about this series are the same ones who sent hate mail over star wars having a black stormtrooper. this series of nsfw cartoons is apparently threatening to the traditionally unwashed neckbeards and that in and of itself makes it a hit in my book. give us more.\",\"so when a person like myself who is not a comic con fanatic and is absolutely amazed and impressed with this series. it speaks volumes for the creator and artists. they did just a superb job directed for adult content imo.i look forward to their future endeavors and season 2. netflix has a winner in this summer tv series.\",\"i was blown away by this series, having accidentally stumbled upon it. all i can remember is thinking every second that it's so good it can't be real, can it? must watch.\",\"i love all the devilman crybaby vibes i get from this show!!! it's disturbingly gruesome at times and laugh out loud funny at others. i haven't even watched the entire season but i'm already looking forward to season 2! if you loved devilman crybaby or black mirror, you'll love this show. if you aren't sure about it, just give it a try because it's honestly so good!!!\",\"all episodes in the show are not consistent, which is one of the reasons why it's so great. there are a plethora of stories that you heavily get sucked into watching without the feeling of stopping. you can binge for a day because they're all under 20min. this is unfortunate, but the show is still very captivating. i cannot stress this enough when i say to watch the show!\",\"undeniably dazzling craftwork to feast your eyes on. each episode is stunning to look at and worth the watch. however, many pieces are let down by derivative stories and characters from the male perspective.quickly got bored of weapons, monsters, and cheesy bros. it became painfully disappointing to be let down when clearly each one was such a visual work of art. made it hard to put a number on the ratings.18 episodes and only 1 with female directors on the team. come on.. you can do better through the selection process and wider narratives.highlights for me:1. three robots (love its stupidity)\\n2. the witness (outstanding technical styling and motion)\\n3. beyond the aquila rift (terrifyingly surreal)\\n4. ice age (microcosm 'mother!' style)\",\"i found this series extraordinary. it made me feel like i did very young when seeing the twilight zone for the first time...a world like ours, but tilted slightly, an engaging story and often a twist at the end. should you find the subject matter the first episode to be a bit too much, i would suggest skipping it. however, it is a terrific episode and well worth viewing. all of the stories include a tweak in the current world, often in the nature of technology. be back soon has elements of romance to it, while other episodes are more thriller or political in nature. they all belong together but each have their own feel. there are cameos by characters in one episode in others, but it's done as a fun thing to spot, not meant to illuminate the stores, which is why this is definitely episodic in nature. highly recommended.\",\"sorry. nope. not wow. i had hoped to enjoy these little clips.after the 3rd one i wanted more. more depth. more character development. any kind of development.like eating a bunch of desserts. sparky and nice but not really fulfilling.for myself, this form leaves a lot to be desired. it is a failure. oh well.\",\"every episode was mini and surprising. we don't know what is the episode is about in the beginning of each episode and there is no connection between previous or next episode. good one😍\",\"every episode was super intriguing and well animated. i wish they'd turn them all into full shows. really good, one of the best series they've made so far.my only complaint is that there isn't more and they're so short i watched them all in a few hours.\",\"i have always liked the anthology works. on the other hand, i also like animation. again, the sci-fi genre is my favorite one. and fantasy, horror, and comedy were at the same time as bonuses. so, this netflix anthology series was perfectly enjoyable for me.every single story was very interesting. though, some of them very known to me. cause i read them as a short story. such as joe r. lansdale's horror story fish night and the dump; ken liu's steampunk story good hunting.but in the series, the storied i liked most was - the witness, beyond the aquila rift, good hunting, the dump, shapeshifters, fish night, helping hand, zima blue, and ice age.overall i liked the series very much. i hoped the second season will come soon with lots of surprises.\",\"bringing back the classing twilight zone commentary under the guise of fiction, black mirror feels only slightly exaggerated from where we're heading in the future. it's a horror classic with our reality laced in science fiction, with superb acting and writing that doesn't seem to quit even in their lesser-liked episodes. it's a win across the board. i recommend it to all of my friends and so should you!\",\"some of the best animation and artwork i have seen in this show. however, the show is too clearly written by men for men, and beyond me is why men love to watch women being raped\\u002ftortured or having a past as such, stories of revenge and some male saving the poor girl.\\ni really don't enjoy watching it and it ruins everything.\",\"well that's a couple hours i'll never get back. i guess i'm alone here, but seriously, people liked this? aside from 1 or 2 mediocre episodes, it was a complete snoozefest. yes, it's visually beautiful, but that's all this show has going for it. it's mostly either tired, played out stories, done a million times before, or complete random nonsense. it's just not worth the time at all.\",\"there a few episodes that are really enjoyable, a few that are average and the odd stinker. i found in series 1, quite a lot of the stories were very similar, and contrary to what i have read from other reviewers, i found series 2 and 3 to be more enjoyable. there are definitely standout episodes - for me the witness, beyond the aquila rift and zima blue (style over substance but they're so short that's kind of a given), and then some that i found to be very boring watches like lucky 13 and the secret war. overall, don't give this a miss, again, some are better than others but i think the point is that many different stories and styes are showcased, so everybody will have their favourites.\",\"amazingly detailed short adult themed stories. loved the variation of animation, from classically drawn anime to ultra futuristic hd.\\nhopefully there will be a season 2 soon 👌\",\"in turn, it is the best. there is a lot of weakness in some parts.\",\"black mirror the original series from bbc was a piece of art. a dark and dystopian view of how technology could benefit our lives and turn horribly wrong at the same time. this original series left you questioning our relationships with technology and what the consequences of our daily habits with it are.but ever since netflix bought the series it just went downhill from there. the overall forced american feel and the need for fancy actors to make up for the disappointing storylines is just disappointing. the original premise of the series just vanished when the last season aired. now the series, like a lot of netflix content is just mediocre and made for entertainment reasons.way to ruin one of the best series in the world netflix.\",\"great series ever. recommend for who love of the idea of the technology and future world.\",\"all following episodes have been awesome. it's like a twisted combination of twilight zone and the canterbury tales by chaucer on steroids. the show shines a light on our dependence on technology, our twisted social paradigms, and our hurtle toward a disturbing dystopian very-near future. every story is a cautionary tale. my advice is to skip the first episode, i wish i had never seen it.\",\"i'm a huge black mirror fan and was extremely honoured to have taken part in one of the episodes. this shows never fails to enlighten and inform us. it's so ahead of it's time and serves as a real lesson to us, even it seems a little weird. life is getting weird, so we better be prepared for what's ahead. charlie brooker is a genius.\",\"i binged the entire series (4 seasons) one weekend in 2018 (over 1,000 combined minutes in 19 episodes). black mirror has been reviewed ad-nauseum, and i have nothing more to add that will influence anyone's viewing decision either way. however, i will offer a brief opine and a selection of the best episodes for your consideration.each episode is a self-contained pseudo-science fiction story, running anywhere from 43 minutes to nearly 90 minutes. i can compare it to an updated version of the twilight zone, at least that's the first thing i thought of. except, in black mirror the characters aren't really in another dimension per se, they're in the now and all the freaky stuff that happens is 'common' among the population.technology, and how it can affect (sometimes adversely) everyday life is the centerpiece of each episode. if you're looking for a feel-good series with predictable plots you're not going to find it in black mirror. you'll see the dark side of humanity and what people are capable of when this cool technology is exploited for all the wrong reasons: some of these episodes get really gloomy.although each story can stand on its own (you can afford to miss episodes and still know what's going on), i counted least seven chapters that briefly refer to another in the series (like a specific piece of technology, or a quote from a character). if you miss the reference, though, it's not going to totally throw you for a loop.among the dark themes, there is some humor. odd, creepy humor. don't feel weird or awkward laughing at certain situations that may otherwise be inappropriate. i was horrified after the first episode in season 1 (the national anthem). truly sickened, in fact. when i watched it a second time, i giggled like a mad-man. but it's that humor that makes black mirror a fun and addictive series to watch. some of the 'laugh-out-loud' moments, for me, were in seeing justice get served to the deserving. what boundaries will they cross in the next season i wonder?my favorite episodes are:season 1, episode 3: the entire history of you (9\\u002f10)season 2, episode 2: white bear (9\\u002f10)season 2, episode 4: white christmas (10\\u002f10)season 3, episode 1: nosedive (9\\u002f10)season 3, episode 3: shut up and dance (10\\u002f10)season 3, episode 6: hated in the nation (9\\u002f10)season 4, episode 3: crocodile (9\\u002f10)season 4, episode 6: black museum (9\\u002f10)\",\"loved every episode, would highly recommend watching\",\"it had been been a long time since netflix unveiled something as exiting and original as this. at first, i was skeptical about the genre, since iv'e never really been a fan of horror fiction. however, this tv show is so well made that it me change my mind.\\nwhat makes it so special is how every episode's story is really unique and original. they even managed to include brilliant insights different social problems (obvious in the second episode\\\" the three robots\\\", where one of the robots tells the two others how the humans came to extinction).\\ni also found that it was really interesting how they used different animation techniques for each episodes. some of them look like they are taking places in video games, others are made by stop motion and the rest are similar to disney movies.\\ni'd really hope to see more tv shows like this in the future!\",\"must watch. gripping stories. engaging dialogues. breath taking vfx and graphics.

each episode. the special appearances by actors and early career roles for actors in the series is great as well. watch it and you most likely won't regret it.\",\"if you are fan of adult animation then this is must watch for you. i can assure that you won't regret.\",\"it's basically a tv show in which nothing goes out well in the end.\",\"netflix out does themselves once again! i thought that season 2 and season 3 (season 4 for me wasn't their best piece of work yet) of black mirror was boundary pushing television, but love, death + robots delivers something unique once again!!18 themed

starting slowly and then getting pace. \\nno living person should miss it. \\nthanks \\nrahul lakra\",\"these short films are incredible, there's nothing more to it. i've watched half of this season of anthology short films and i can't wait to watch the rest of them.the shorts are incredibly detailed in its animations. the stories in each of the shorts are great, weird, horrific in a good way, and hilarious. i'd say that episode 6, 'when the yogurt took over', is my favorite out of every episode that i've seen, because it's so outrageous that it's brilliant. episode 8 is also a favorite of mine, and i would actually love to see more of that story because it's an incredibly cool concept. the animation in that episode is a solid 10\\u002f10.i'd recommend this to anyone who loves great stories, great animation (both 2d as well as 3d), and to anyone who doesn't have time to bingewatch an entire 22-episode, 45-minute season.\",\"black mirror is one outstanding series that introduces its audience to unique, interesting, problematic and worst of all terrifyingly possible visions of the future. each episode tells a different story with a set of new characters (as an anthology does), but one main character stays the same - technology. black mirror isn't annoying with anti-technology messages, it doesn't have the \\\"oh, technology bad, book good\\\" mindset, it focuses on many aspects and possibilities that technology may bring in the future, it doesn't judge, instead lets the viewers do the judgement and come to their own conclusions which was a breath of fresh air to be honest. the first and second seasons were a nice introduction to what the creators had in mind and to the message of black mirror. third and fourth seasons can only be described as masterpieces. all four come with thought-provoking plots and unexpected twists. boredom is nonexistent. next comes the fifth season aka black mirror's downfall. this season brought us three episodes, they weren't necessarily bad they were very much okay but it felt like you were watching a different series entirely. the creators must have lost their initial focus. the episodes weren't filled with gore, technological advancements, ethical dilemmas, they weren't mind boggling as they once were. you didn't stare in terror or fascination. fifth season lacked the originality and philosophy aspects that made black mirror remarkable. the plots were lazy, nothing crazy, each episode had a celebrity starring cause let's show our audience how much we don't care anymore, we want the money. they brought anthony mackie (e1), andrew scott (e2) and miley cyrus (e3) - and this is not meant to criticise the celebrities, they all did a great job -. this was a huge disappointment for me, i adored this series, i told all my friends to watch it and we discussed what we would do in those bizarre situations, my emotional friends weren't able to finish some episodes because they found them that frightening. it was amazing. and to think this series would throw all it's original initiatives for more views broke my little cinema-obsessed heart.ending this prolonged review. 9 stars. wish i could give it a 10 but i can't forgive the creators for the 5th season. they became what they once called out. not only a shame, a tragedy.\",\"black mirror is a unique series in the world of shows. it is futuristic, thought-provoking, deep and sometimes disturbing.(+) awesome and sleek screenplay and stories(+) amazing and fitting acting by the episodes' cast(+) deep, intelligent and futuristic ideas, well developed in each episode(+) got more dynamic after season 2, with netflix help(+) brightly created and produced by charlie brooker(+) memorable episodes, such as 'be right back', 'the waldo moment', 'san junipero', 'hang the dj', 'striking vipers and 'smithereens'(-) none that i rememberso, when you have such a marvel in hand and real demand from viewers' side, you do them a favor and hopefully release up to a potential season 10. moreover, the seasons are not filled with conveyer-like episodes, so it can be managed with a bit of will and help from the producing side.hope the above is not wishful thinking as black mirror has diamond-like qualities.\",\"it is very funny what happens when some people see the worst side of life, the worst side\\u002fversion of themselves in front of their eyes. black mirror is definately an heir to the twilight zone, the x-files, outer limits etc. it is almost pure sci-fi but based on the truths of our world today. it is disturbing, it is frustrating, it is pesimistic (except one episode, find out which), it is a guide-suggestion, on what to avoid so as not to turn technology\\u002fscience into a freaking waking nightmare. i don't like doing this but in this case i think it is imperative: people, my fellow reviewers... each episode is a \\\"stand alone\\\"! different stories every episode. there is no continuity from ep to ep! that is the show format. for crying out loud, please!black mirror is hu-man in the mirror. the mirror is science\\u002ftechnology. it is up to us to de-black it. make that change.\",\"this was so incredibly good. reminded me of black mirror except with more action and explosions. we need a second season right away netflix!\",\"good animation\\nlots of gore and nudity.not much story or character development.but, hey, what do you expect for 10-15 minute episodes.\",\"the blatant copy of guillermo del toro and frank miller are really annoying. otherwise the space and robot shorts are

of the most captivating shows of all time has been undone by an ill attempted season. it would be grave injustice to not write this review and let people suffer through the terrible monstrosity. do not watch it but with low expectations.apart from 1 or maybe 2 episodes the whole season is without substance, story, script and any concieveable message or \\\"moral of the stories\\\". i don't know what happened and why it happened but the writers deviated from their old ways quite a bit.the one good positive is tha acting. they sure employed brilliant actors who did their job wonderfully, even in the awful episdoes.\",\"very nice for people that like animation. to me, the episode \\\"witness\\\" was a really interesting one.\\nit's a mix o comedy, good animation and storytelling

watch for everyone who loves creativity and art.however some on the stories fall flat, ending abruptly, or has no real substance apart from visuals, so a true rating would be 8 or 9 but i give it a 10

tempt to binge.suggesting a break cos it covers a crazy range of topics, genres...can't even classify. but every single episode has a story, and a damn good story at that. and with a run time of 10-20 minutes, it has been incredibly done.the only comparison i can think of is black mirror...superb stories, characters and production all across. it gets even better with ld&b. the details for backgrounds, stage settings for each scene, angle of direction, lightings, art style, and of course the character details are on a level for 15 minute shorts.this is an epitome of an anthology for short stories, with each having their individual animation\\u002fgraphic style. and that's actually a damn good thing. unlike the superb 2000s animatrix, here each episode is a completely different story with no constraints of relating to a larger picture.started season 3 after forgetting this series and on episode 2 now. had to give a shoutout before continuing. unsure if it was a good thing that i'd forgotten about it or not.ps. edited last couple of paragraphs after watching s3e1.\",\"each story unique, each animation style different, and each plot line masterfully developed and every

top notch.\\nit is hard to get one as a favourite, all of them are good on their own style and story telling.\\nthis series should have more awards!\",\"brilliant story lines and amazing twists with out of this world cgi beautifully made and must see\",\"terrifying creatures, wicked surprises and dark comedy converge in this nsfw anthology of animated stories presented by tim miller and david fincher. an amazingly creative, fun range of subjects and settings ranging from intelligent cyberpunk sci-fi to creepy horror, one of the best netflix originals in a while. through stunning animation, the series illustrates surreal worlds and fantastical themes, and although at times the stories are hard to digest, they're certainly thought-provoking and worth discussing.\",\"it is the best animeted show i watched. it has great vision. you should watch this show quickly as possible.\",\"each episode is just one hour but it feels like you have seen a movie. high production quality. its not only about technology but about human emotions. best blend of technology and human emotions. this is the only tv series i finished all the episodes. i could not wait to watch the next one. do not miss it.\",\"... i have good news for you.\\nthis is the most incredible series of films i've seen in many many years.i literally feel like a kid again.i barely watch movies these days, because i know i'll be bored to death.but this... just wow...the excitement i get from this... it's just too amazing!the brutally rad artwork.\\nthe deep, emotional stories about characters that we actually care and

out.\",\"the tall grass episode is a lot like the stephen king and joe hill short story and netflix video. not only are the names the same but some of the creepy things that happened are really close. but yet no mention that i could see of where this material came from. makes me wonder.\",\"this might be the best anthology series on netflix, which is saying a lot considering i'm a lifelong fan of american horror story. but every episode of this show is animated differently, and every episode feels different, and i love every single episode. you also have to respect the sheer creativity of the show. every single episode is a different story and i cannot wait for volume two.\",\"great show. each episode in this series deals with misadventures with technology, essentially showing how technology can screw humanity over. as a result, there's not overarching narrative here, but more of a unifying concept. the episodes are variable in their quality and shock-factor, certainly the original seasons where better. there's some less appealing episodes (e.g. the one which features miley cyrus) and more climactic episodes which result in some shocking revelations at the end. all in all, this is a show you can easily tap in and out of, but there's a good chance you won't be able to resist binging it anyway.\",\"this show is fantastic. really well thought out way of showing tech in the near to far future. i love it and im a tech fanatic. well worth the watch!\",\"it is very good, everyone should see it, it is a different thing in this which is different from everything, i have never seen such a thing on tv in my life.\",\"the 4th season might've not been so black mirror-ish, but it still shows the dark side of technology as intended. though it may lean more towards style over substance in more than one case, black mirror still finds plenty of opportunities to perplex and depress\",\"i must say that i was totally blown away by these short animations, the story's brought out the best in what surrealism has to offer to the screen . what i particularly liked is that they were short stories , some were funny some not so funny, and really quite a mix bag of different things.i sometimes wonder whats going on with in story tellers heads when they come up with this surreal fantasy stuff.the animations and cartoon animations are mostly intended for an adult audience, with.a blend of humour chucked in the mix at the same time.not sure sure who thinks this stuff up but it's definitely worth the watch, particularly if you want to watch something that's easey listening and viewing, you won't be disappointed.\",\"i had to edit my review.i gave love, death & robots a 10\\u002f10 based on the first 7 episodes, which are really good.but right after \\\"beyond the aquila gates\\\" (e07) the quality drops dramatically with plots being boring or utterly obsolete. even the cgi you are presented with is less impressive and outstanding. but if what you are presented with is just mindless action without any character development, no emotional attachment to any character, no plot, no visual wow-effect, then there is nothing left but a boring exercise in cgi, that i am willing to acknowledge, but with a disinterested nod. you can throw a mindless masterpiece of wild action, devoid of any depth at me once or twice, but if that's all you have i'm out.i'd rate episodes 7 to 16 with a 4\\u002f10 leaving the whole collection of shorts with a 7\\u002f10.\",\"i don't know what to say but this show is really fascinating. you could realize what will happen in the future is appears in black mirror show\",\"it's unique and fresh. just watch it! thanks netflix for this masterpiece!\",\"seriously. i paused it mid way through the first episode to leave a review to encourage ppl to watch this. animation is amazing, the story telling is impressive especially in 17 minutes. not sure how every episode after the first will pan out but the pilot shows ridiculous promise. this is no animation for kids thats for sure. a lot of people are really gonna enjoy this, i know i am\",\"if you wanna know what happens when humans with immature emotional balance & high technology coexist & also clashes with each other!!\",\"probably one of the most overrated series of all time. the only positive trait of it is the animation, that explores a lot of styles and do this with uniquiness. but the stories are all empty, with no purpose if not to impress with it's imagery. the majority of them is so empty that don't even provoque feelings. some episodes provoque it, but are so shallow and with nowhere to redirect it that makes it even worse. the pleasure of feeling with some scene is that we know the consequences for the story. but it's nothing what happens on this series: if someone dies here, thats what the show want us to see; if someone lives, idem. so the agony that i felt for the character is all gone sometimes even when the episode isn't even over - or for have understood this, the feeling doesn't even come up. this leave me with a lack that bothers me a lot: needing somewhere to put my feelings (an affection, a cheering, a wish, a willingness...). some of the episodes provoque feelings and have a great background, with a nice message to the viewer, but these ones are the rarest and isolated cases. even those ones with messages are also with a shallow lesson, needing a good development by the viewer to get to some nice thought. that's all can be said about love, death & robots. a entire series with no purpose, no depth, without messages. and it's not a intrinsic characteristic of anthologies. much more could be done, and it had so much potential to do it - but it looks like that they don't even try.\",\"i don't know who had the original idea for this, but i want some of what he\\u002fshe had....\\nwhat a concept.. excellent story-lines, great acting, great direction, great production..

not that it's bad, but as i said. not indicative.\",\"ok- i wouldn't rate alle the parts with 9 stars, but most of them. scary science fiction that is a good critique of the dark side of modern

humor as well.i've watched this series through 3 times by now and rewatched my favourite ones even more. my ultimate favorite is zima blue ! it's so cute, wholesome, and pure, but also deep, philosophical, and even insightful.there are episodes that make you think, and episodes that are just whack - but that's good either way :dstrongly recommend everyone at least try watching the show and am looking forward to the next season(s) !!\",\"i may just not be a fan of short stories. most of the time there's just not enough to get me invested. so for most of these episodes, my feeling was, \\\"meh.\\\" but there are a few i love.lots of different animation styles. lots of different ideas and concepts. i've rated each episode on it's page, but here is a summary for reference with a few notes for some.season 1: 6 stars (2-3 viewings, 8\\u002f1\\u002f2023)sonnie's edge 9 stars. oozes cool, gives me goosebumps. my favorite of the first 3 seasons.three robots 8 stars. hilarious, i would watch a whole movie of this.the witness 6 stars. great animation. story feels pointless.suits 6 stars.sucker of souls 6 stars. really cool but missing that oomph. i wanted it to keep going and was annoyed when it ended.when the yogurt took over 6 stars. pretty funny and interesting.beyond the aquila rift 8 stars. i love this episode. and i immediately added the song living in the shadows to my music library.good hunting 6 stars.the dump 5 stars. eh. not bad but feels pointless.shape-shifters 6 stars.helping hand 5 stars.fish night 3 stars. really dumb.lucky 13 - 4 stars. there just is nothing here. and while the animation style goes for realism, the flight scenes and explosions don't feel real.zima blue 4 stars.blindspot 6 stars.ice age 6 stars.alternate histories 3 stars. i can't stand this animation style.the secret war 4 stars.season 2: 5 stars (1-2 viewings, 8\\u002f4\\u002f2023)automated customer service 5 stars. fairly amusing but i can't stand this animation style.ice 6 stars. visually stimulating.pop squad 4 stars.snow in the desert 5 stars.the tall grass 5 stars.all through the house 3 stars.life hutch 6 stars.the drowned giant 2 stars. how can something 10 mins

is amusing but didn't make me laugh nearly as much.bad travelling 8 stars. \\\"directed by david fincher.\\\" i was stunned. he's only my second favorite director ever. of course it's him, this episode is amazing.the very pulse of the machine 6 stars.night of the mini dead 8 stars. so cool. feels like an entire movie crammed into five minutes. so many events so fast.kill team kill 8 stars.

stars.jibaro 7 stars. perfect example of how you do a short story. images are beautiful and stunning.\",\"if you really enjoy indulging your depression, feelings of paranoia about society, and hatred of technology, you'll probably like this show. if, like me, you don't, you'll find this series utterly unwatchable. i'm a huge fan of the twilight zone, and for those that try to compare black mirror to it, what on earth are you talking about? tz had social commentary, sure, but it was renowned for great plots with ironic or twist endings, not poorly drawn out plots that leave you drained of all joy. which is what black mirror does every single episode. like i said, unless you enjoy that type of entertainment, avoid this garbage.\",\"i cant even imagine, how did human kind make this amazing serie.\",\"based on the limited marketing that had leeched into my infosphere, i had semi-consciously written off robots as yet another low-sheen manga snoozefest. yesterday i pushed past my ingrained resistance and actually clicked on the title. what i saw there caught my attention, something which i was not in the slightest expecting. seeing that my total commitment to an initial taste-test would be in the range of 10 minutes, i decided to take the plunge.wow! i was instantly immersed in a compelling 3d world that evoked some of my favourite sci-fi imagery and ideas, with a satisfying, elegant narrative wrapped in gorgeous visuals made with exceptional love and stellar production values. robots is deeply engaging, delivering innovative and playful twists on familiar sci-fi tropes, cutting new and interesting ground in hybrid animation and visual style. what a reminder, yet again, to never make assumptions about a netflix-ordered production. whilst not every episode was to my taste, the great majority were awesomely good, and i had to restrain myself to leave at least a few episode-morsels to savour at a later time. props, netflix & co for plastering a silly, satisfied grin on my face.\",\"it's one of the best series i've ever watched. there were excellent episodes, there were also good episodes. sometimes it's bad :)\",\"this is a great series one you start you won't stop!! very original and amazing graphics\",\"it's stark, chilling, funny, acerbic, gut wrenching, thought provoking and complex. there are some duds, (like the waldo moment and the miley cyrus episode) but the majority are superb. the entire history of you and fifteen million credits in particular stayed with me for days, as well as white christmas. i genuinely wanted to quit my phone, sell my stuff and move off grid after watching a few of them, but like everyone else im hopelessly addicted. which is the point brookers trying to make.the stories are wonderfully intricate and multi faceted and offer a stark glimpse into our futures. be right back was devastating to watch, as my husband died 15 years ago, and goodness..that one hurt to watch. but its not all sad and gloomy, hang the dj and uss callister are more uplifting. i watched them from season 5 to 1 (just because) and it was interesting to see the budget diminish, along with some pretty sweet cgi, but even the first season worked well without it. i really hope it doesn't lose it's originality and penchant to..well, mirror us, for the sake of big named stars becoming involved.\",\"i couldn't make it through more than three episodes, so it might get better; but i doubt it. the first two episodes were well animated, but with pretty shallow and poorly acted stories. the third episode was poorly animated, poorly acted, and bizarrely animated.shallow, poorly acted, predictable, and overly interested in being edgy.\",\"each episode is a short, mostly animated, film. each one is masterfully crafted, true eye candy & art. a real treat to watch, but may take a bit of stamina to sit through the whole series if you are faint-hearted: the series carries a lot of r-rated imagery - the most prominent being violence which includes gore as well as & sometimes including female nudity with lovemaking. the purpose for the film's though, while visually sensational, are not fully void of intelligence, wit or thought: they each carry quality story-telling that carries significant messages for consideration.i know i'll find myself rewatching every episode & though i'll have my favourites, i can't say there was a single one that wasn't exceptional in exocution & well, ... damn cool.my only criticism is that the title is so cute, which suggested for me, & set up an expectation for, more variety in subject matter: the majority of stories are quite violent as opposed to cute, & i felt that overall they each carried very masculine qualities. i wonder at the percentage of womem involved in the writing & exocution of each episode. since there are so many episodes, more variety of content containing more exploration of how love, death & robots could be combined would be appreciated.please make more !!!\",\"for me personally, i couldn't ask for a more entertaining, well-animated and neatly written series than this right now. it just popped into existence right when i didn't know i needed it the most.it's sort of dark at times, but always with a light, happy-go-lucky touch to justify some of the (arguably) oversaturated violence and gore. i loved it, but i can see certain people not enjoyimg it as much.if you love sci-fi, you're going to want to watch love, death + robots.\",\"this is truly an amazing show. the issues that the show grapples with and illuminates in each episode are timely and significant. to say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison. the stories are mostly set in a dystopian world that is dominated or badly influenced by modern technology. what makes \\\"black mirror\\\" so great is the attention to detail and inter\\u002fintrapersonal relationships and how the main character would feel and experience its brave new world.\\nwell thought out plots, characters, settings and really good storytelling. it asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. or maybe already have taken us. definitely worth seeing! treat yourself and watch this. 9\\u002f10\",\"love it, very reminiscent of the animatrix where you don't have to like all of them but a majority of it is damn good.\",\"i never write reviews but i really hope tim miller and co. bring us a season 2! like black mirror and the animatrix, it weaves weird and awesome stories with visual flair!\",\"its just a true masterpiece!!!! but i hope there are more episodes in a series. after every episode you think that it would be great if a another episode of that same story exists. it is that much great. every episode contains its own story. and a episode is only 10-12 minutes (sometimes higher and sometimes lesser). you can think it is like a collection of short movies.\",\"i just watched nosedive episode. and i almost cried. i watched every mayor show that is runned in the last 20 years and this one, well, this one is different. all business about the tv shows, movies are went to s..t long time a go, it's all just making money and repeating endlessly same old patterns, same trick, red herrings, stories, bla bla, you name it. but this show is smart, really smart, and different and i mean like really different. it's a glimpse into a possible future, a warning, a questioning what are we f...cking doing, we humans, beautifull and god made. sorry for bad english and mistakes, i'm drunk a little and english is not my native language. anyway, if you want something that's different, smart, perfectly executed, and will make you think about humanity and your own soul, just watch it, you will not regret it...\",\"i went into this expecting something along the lines of short-form 'black mirror', but what i actually got was 'heavy metal' 2019 (at least for the most part). this collection of shorts is filled to the brim with violence, nudity and b-movie narratives. some episodes know how to pull this off in a charming way (sucker of souls, three robots, suits), while others take themselves so seriously, that the subpar writing turns from endearing to embarrassing (aquila rift, sonnie's edge, shape-shifters).there is an inherent charm to the whole thing, once you accept that it's basically exploitation-trash. violence and sex are shown for the sake of it, and i believe that's perfectly fine, if you don't pretend to be more than that. but, when one of the 'deeper' episodes (aquila rift) interrupts its brief story for a minute-long softcore scene, i rolled my eyes a bit. in combination with its uncanny valley-like animation, i had bad flashbacks to the awkward sex-scenes in mass effect.and then, there are the outliers like 'zima blue', 'fish night', 'when the yogurt took over', which were more akin to the kind of shorts i was expecting before going in. these aren't necessarily more intriguing than their trashier counter-parts, but they still stick out.most of the shorts simply lack a certain punchline or interesting idea that you could only truly realize in this specific format. a lot of them feel either aimless, or like boiled-down action movies. the one that really got it right was 'helping hand'. you have a simple set-up and a smart conclusion that fits the theme of the show. it doesn't overstay its welcome, and it doesn't try to emulate long-form movies. it's an idea that works best for a short-film.apart from the 'lifelike' art-style (which, unfortunately, is used rather often), i really enjoyed the animation. some favorites are 'the witness', 'sucker of souls' and 'good hunting'.the show can be trashy fun, with short bursts of more subtle ideas. but if you were expecting something with a little more substance, you will be disappointed.\",\"love, death & robots is rather odd series consisting of random animated stories of no more than 20 minutes in length.however, odd though it may be the quirkiness and storylines vary so much that there is something to please everyone.the main thing i enjoyed was just how different the animation was with each new episode. the detail in some of them is incredible and it's clear a lot of time was put in getting them right.overall, i enjoyed the series.7 out of 10.\",\"honestly, who even animates this thing, because damn! it is so visually appealing and accurate that it's a wonder to watch for the way it's been drawn alone, not to mention the great storylines and the way they manage to capture so much in so little screen time. most of the times, the story is deeper than one would expect and the characters are very well thought out.\",\"i loved every episode of this series and to me it came from nowhere. i dont know who wrote and directed any episode, but it was outstanding and original. i'm sad tha hollywood has no new ideas when a few of these would make great films in the same style (sonnies edge, three robots, suits, beyond the aquila rift and shape shifters) would all make amazing films as long as they kept the same feel and ideas. i hope they do more of these and they become available to buy in hard copy forms. again, outstanding.\",\"it's a tough show to review because each episode is a stand alone movie. some of these 'movies' have been some of the best tv i have seen. some are just mediocre and increasingly more often in season 5 & 6 where majority of episodes are mediocre and no stand out. i'm giving this a 9 out 10 just by looking at season 1-4.one reason i love the show is because it's a unique program often full of dark futuristic stories that really make you think about technology now and the future but also about broader human nature in stories unrelated to tech or the future. taking chances like this will of course produce some misses but the mystery is what the story will be be about is addicting. in s1-4 it was often difficult to know where the story going -- often surprising you a few times while keeping you in suspense. s5 & s6 are less surprising and less important topics or just a bit too out there. i give s5 & s6 a 6.5\\u002f10. worth a watch but not thrilling like first 4 seasons where i was hooked on the show.\",\"black mirror was once known for projecting a grim future, 10 minutes away from where we are. we didn't watch it to be amused nor excited, we watched it with the intent of being bummed out. we expected to welcome the credits with an awesome feeling of self loathe. this was the point. black mirror is the reflection of yourself in your phone screen when the screen is turned off. a dark reflection of who you are. the intention is to show a dark depiction of ourselves through technology. exactly what a black mirror is.throughout its time on channel4 it was allowed to explore this, thus generating a huge following of people like myself who demand depth, intrigue and not your typical fairytale stories made to meet a wide audience to generate ££. it was so ridiculously thought provoking i would go as far as to say it was one of the greatest tv programmes to come out of the uk! which leads me to the problem.. it came out of the uk.i was slightly nervous when i discovered it was moving to netflix. anxious as i knew the americans were going to have a huge hand in the subject matter and storylines, yet marginally comfortable in knowing netflix (like channel4) has a reputation for taking risks on out of the box stories. the reason i was anxious about the americans is not some deep shred of racism. it is simply that there is a huge difference between how british and american audiences receive tv programmes. this is common fact when it comes to comedy, but it is also apparent in emotion inducing drama too. if you study popular american tv versus popular uk tv you can easily see that british audiences are more comfortable with 'out of the ordinary', uncomfortable and especially dark subject matter. we don't mind hating ourselves, in fact we quite like it and are pretty good at it!series 3 turned out to be pretty damn good actually. san junipero in particular is my favourite episode of the whole programme! the programme was allowed to retain that awful feeling of dread, the familiarity, the dark techno-aware subjects that depicted who we could be, who we would be and who we are now! there did seem to be a little more of a hollywood type of feel to the whole thing, yet that didn't matter too much as long as the stories could run their course!however. since then there has been a huge decline in what we come to expect of the show we know and love. uss callister was, for me a small shining light (or rather a welcome opposite to that entirely), but still didn't give me that sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach. the episodes began to get milder and milder, taming down to suit a wider audience who would be at greater risk of running away if you were to show them an early episode. yes there was tragedy, yes some of the storylines were dark. but its where the darkness comes from that matters! we didn't want obviously fictional narratives, we wanted ones that seemed real! that could be here and now and not too far away. we didn't want the big dramatic moments, the killer shots or the epic finale, we want mellow darkness and discomfort.finally we reach series 5. a series that has completely and utterly disappointed me on all levels. well, not all. they are entertaining, but definitely not in black mirror fashion. where are the twists, the thought provoking, self hating moments. the situations which present to you a perfectly twisted, yet astonishingly accurate version of the world we live in?if you were to grab someone who was disinterested in black mirror's subject matter, and ignorant of its relevance and show them just a couple of episodes from the first series, but let them just mildly watch it without truly getting it.. then ask them to describe it to you: what you would have is series 5.... a few entertaining yet dark stories with a bit of technology thrown in. yes we know that the app they use in episode two is metaphorical of our current social media platforms and how we are all addicted. you are not incredibly smart for figuring that out because it's so blindingly obvious and in your face. black mirror has been showing us that same metaphor in so many episodes, but it's been so good because it has been a genuinely clever metaphor and has been presented perfectly!i genuinely feel as though the smartness of the programme has been lost. that it has now become a parody of itself and is simply a few slightly tragic (but not too tragic) stories with some technology in them. it doesn't take a great deal of intellect or understanding to grasp the concepts. themes are also being rehashed into more diluted versions that are easier to palette for everyone! this might sound extremely harsh and make me sound like an awful person, but i see from my social media, so many more people talking about how amazing it now is. these people are the type that find films such as white chicks funny and who's favourite film is titanic. they talk about how clever the programme is after watching the latest series and that it's got so much more better as they didn't understand the first few series. i find myself internally screaming at them \\\"no you don't deserve to appreciate this programme\\\" the message is lost on so many!i still have faith, which is why i've given a 9. the first 3 series get 10 from me, the 5th gets a 2.\",\"used to be such an interesting and creepy show and it became a joke\",\"from the moment i turned it o. i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. the animation is perfect. different styles. i loved the animation in episode 3 keep em coming please\",\"ok so it's now 2023 and i'm catching-up with this but for 2011 it's got a lot of crazy predictions which truly did happen and are spookingly accurate.unfortunately if i wrote down how accurate they are people may not believe me but british people definitely see the similarities.brexit is talked about and it's 100% accurate even though when it was casted and filmed it was all what-if scenarios.it's got some extremely edgy scenes which are not required for family-viewing. the darkness is relentless. the humour and satire shines.it's brilliantly-written and the dialogue is incredible intense. it's go a stellar casting and the dystopian future is portrayed at a level of ai one is not ready for yet. but it could be so incredible realistic and believable with our mesmerising advances in recent years.however to save and store all that data is just incredible and that as well as human rights and legal issues is why these dystopias are still dystopias and will probably not happen.the direction is quality. i feel like i'm present in every episode. the cinema is strong. great close-ups of ferocious on-screen arguments which really boil over and make me wonder if something extremely grave will occur at every nano-second when the pressure point occurs.it's an excellent thrill-ride and i'm very surprised of the reviewing figures on imdb. i thought it would be much more. it's brilliant and we need much more fresh tv such as this. excellent work! didn't want to provide spoilers; just watch it!\",\"'love, death & robots' is, unfortunately, rather disappointing. the premise for this animated anthology series is a rather good one, allowing for a variety of creative adult-aimed animations, which is somewhat of a rarity. however, the delivery is far from perfect. the biggest issue here is the writing. while each individual short has clearly been animated by different groups of people, allowing for a huge variety of styles that individualise them, most of the short stories have been adapted by the same person. this means that despite the visual differences, the writing issues are carried over throughout the entire series. firstly, the dialogue is mostly unconvincing and this really makes it hard to care about the characters, which obviously limits investment. another issue with the writing is that most episodes have the same structure, which makes things more predictable as the series progresses. it doesn't help that this structure isn't all that great to begin with. the shorts aren't constructed as if they are short films (which, at the end of the day, they are), but rather as if they are long-form stories (whether that be full series, or in some cases feature films) condensed to a very short time. of course, this makes them feel very rushed which limits investment even further. it also doesn't help that most of them are based around some sort of twist or reveal. most of the time, this just comes out of nowhere and feels like something tacked-on to garner shocks, rather than a natural part of the narrative (there are a few standouts to this, however, such as 'the witness'). this is perhaps down to the actual writing rather than the story, though. the narratives also often end really abruptly and unsatisfyingly, which leaves a negative lasting impression of the shorts. it seems as though they realised that they only had a short amount of time and decided to just end the episode at the point in which that ran out. another issue with the series as a whole is, despite it purporting to be an 'adult' show, it is actually very childish. it's as if it has been devised by a group of thirteen year-old boys with a fresh insight on swearing and the female anatomy, making the majority of bad language and nudity just come across as gratuitous and unnecessary. most of the more mature aspects rarely add to the stories and that's a shame because if used appropriately, they could have created a more adult tone that allowed for a deeper exploration of certain themes. unfortunately though, they just make the majority of shorts feel immature and crass. it's also very sexist as a whole, unnecessarily objectifying women on several occasions, which can be rather uncomfortable. the show isn't completely bad, though. in fact there are a few episodes that, for the most part, avoid the aforementioned issues (such as 'three robots' and 'zima blue') and others that are interesting enough to get past some of the bigger issues. another highlight is, of course, the animation. each episode has a unique visual style and, for the most part, this really elevates the stories and makes them more enjoyable as you can see the care and attention given to that side of things. it's just a shame that the writing doesn't live up to this. overall, 'love, death & robots' is definitely disappointing on the whole due to its many issues, although the quality of the shorts does fluctuate and there are definitely some good episodes here. a lot of them are worth a look purely for the animation, too. it's decent, but doesn't live up to its full potential, especially with some of the big names attached to it. 6\\u002f10\",\"i am not finished all seasons and episodes but it is enough to see first season to write some good review about this article. this extraordinary serial shows you if you are so deep into the technology how its affect you. the best of the serial is the episodes are not linked to each other. each episodes gives you a short movie taste.\",\"really a fantastic show. great stories made even greater by the addition of well known actors and actresses in some of the roles. love how this show isn't afraid to broach even the most taboo of subjects and actors who aren't afraid to take on the roles and subject matter that will ultimately only boost their careers. unlike people of the past most of us have learned that just because an actor plays a role it doesn't mean they are that kind of person in real life. as a result, we can enjoy seeing them in many different roles in many different lights and appreciate this show for what it is. an incredible work of art.\",\"must watch!!!!!!!!!!!! every episode is really unique and full of suspense. it is so engaging and wonderful experiance is guaranteed...it should have continued with more episodes.\",\"could not stop watching this series end to end. each episode was unique in delivery, content and with no f__ks given

media savi team of writers.well worth a watch for the will he won't he suspense of the first episode.make some time in your schedule to see this and look forward to discussing it with people afterwards.looking forward to this writing team coming back with more funds to deliver bigger and better.the ten lines of text minimum is a real pain when you are in a hurry to watch the next episode.enjoy.\",\"let's start with the fact that there's less than half the number of episodes in the 2nd anthology; maybe covid was a factor, maybe not, but going from 18 episodes in the 1st anthology to 8 in the second is disappointing, to say the least.secondly, i didn't get the originality in the 2nd series that happened in the first. so many more kinds of animation, so many different tones to strike in the first; the second is really lame by comparison.lastly - and let's be real here - nudity and sex was part of the novelty and appeal of the 1st go-around, and there's almost none in the second. it's like they didn't even try to out-do themselves the second time. loved-loved-loved the first series, so very disappointed in the second. take that for what you will.\",\"this is one of those series where you just have to push past that first episode to get sucked in completely. i agree with those who were offended, and i almost turned back, but i had the same experience at some point early in breaking bad, and we all know how that one went down. and although i was horrified by the first episode, i have to say that it actually was one of the post powerful and on target ones that deal with the dark power of social media. the writers are fearless. black mirror is one of the shows that i most anticipate the next season. and i love anthologies. there are not enough of them out there.\",\"season one, wow. i still rewatched something of my favorites. such mind bending ideas and twisty plots. i was so impressed by this original idea of adult animation. just like netflix does, they hook you in with the initial concept and originality. if you're wanting to watch something compelling yet not too long as to where you get bored or distracted easily. watch season one. won't regret it.now season two...i can't say i'm really surprised. netflix has this horrible reputation of ruining great original ideas and pumping them dry until they are almost universally hated. 8 episodes after a 18 episode first season. i mean come on. the spark that captured a lot of viewers originally has completely vanished. maybe it's one of those concepts that really can't redo the beauty of what came before. but this was a pathetic attempt. personally, i blame netflix for most likely heavy handing the production. this felt like a corporate, pg-13, cash grabby rip off of the first season. visuals are still extremely impressive, but the over all quality of story telling and original ideas is lacking anything fresh or shocking. which in my mind, is what season one did so well. originally it was a 9\\u002f10. sadly, it's fallen to a 6. very disappointed.\",\"some advice.... go and re-assess black mirror past seasons before saying it is rubbish now.i have never believed that black mirror is a perfect show. i have never believed that everything charlie brooker is either funny or spot on.what i do believe is that charlie brooker always has interesting ideas that intrigue or interest me and cause me to think on something in a way i haven't necessarily considered.the episodes he puts out are never perfect for every viewer and his theme is not always clear or his point not made hugely well. some episodes are just fun and some i think are more for charlie himself because \\\"screw everyone else's view, i just like it\\\".so again i say reflect on past episodes, i think every episode satisfies the \\\"i wonder what this one is about\\\" requirement of black mirror and if the execution of every episode is not successful i don't care. genuinely, i enjoy every episode for every idea and enjoy the \\\"would i have explored that theme that way\\\" post viewing debate and discussion.but that's just me.\",\"this show honestly very much impressed me and netflix really outdid themselves. every episode is so different and incredible within themselves. i feel like i could've watched some of these episodes as full length movies. some of the most realistic cgi i've ever seen when applicable but the art styles in other episodes is enough to fall in love with every time. nearly every idea in every episode is so unique and most so interesting that it's easy to enjoy no matter what genre you prefer. it's extremely original. overall this is absolutely worth the watch. i really don't have much to complain about but i can't give it a 10\\u002f10 because as good and amazing as it is, it's impossible to say it's perfect. the one thing i would complain about is that they're a bit overzealous at times with the nsfw content, some of the jokes in many episodes fall a bit flat, and i feel they try to make you feel too attached at times with the limited screen time each story has. however this show more than makes up for what it lacks and i will recommend it 100% of the time.\",\"in this second anthologyin addition, the second group is not as good as a wholebut at least they got their money under the table.\",\"ld&r doesnt try to entertain yoy. doesnt conform to to your reguler story troupe. it tells you its own story and you are entertained by it! a fresh prespective to series making (same blueprint with black mirror but animated), enjoyed every bit of it.\",\"i absolutely loved every single episode, i never ever wanted it to end. the bizzareness was on point, the feeling of unease, but being completely mesmerized at the same time, was a unique and very enjoyable combination to experience. what a show, i wish there was more of this.\",\"watched this based on a recommendation from a friend and i am beyond impressed. some of the episodes like 2 and 13 (lucky 13) i had to watch multiple times, just so good. this is must watch sci-fi as far as im concerned.\",\"some episodes are good, some are ok, and some are very bad. don't understand the hype this show is getting. it's ok but definitely not a masterpiece as some reviews say. the animations are extremely good but the stories not so. but its

though,or do rush it...whatever. i'll miss it when i'm finished watching. that's the only regret!futuristic mind-blower. yay! thanks netflix for this recommendation.\",\"first of all, i must state that the animation in all episodes was extraordinary. i don't have any experience in creating animation but as a keen viewer of many animated films and shows, i was quite satisfied with the quality of it as much as the first volume. i think the major issue with the new volume is that it fails to be the anthology series it promises to be, the content is good, but the motives and world-building are repetitive and too limited to be an anthology, especially compared to its previous volume. i know by definition, it still qualifies as an anthology, but a pretty narrow one in my opinion. below are the three repeating motives i've categorized:\\\"automated customer service\\\" & \\\"life hunch\\\"\\ntwo episodes on malfunctioning robots - we all love the \\\"robot goes rogue and screws things up for those around it\\\" storyline, but seeing it twice in an anthology with only eight chapters felt quite repetitive. even though the episodes were different from each other in various aspects, (animation, setting, characters) their plots were both revolving around a character trying to survive against a malfunctioning robot that was designed to help them but was operating in the completely opposite way. also, having only 1\\u002f4 of the show tell stories with robots while the show's title is 1\\u002f3 robots is a bit off-putting.\\\"ice\\\", \\\"pop squad\\\" & \\\"snow in the desert\\\"\\nthree episodes on enhanced individuals and their relationship with those outcasts in the system - they were all different in their world-building and \\\"ice\\\" focused on the one ousted individual in the system, \\\"pop squad\\\" did a similar thing for a few enjoyable instances, which were both good choices i think. the \\\"snow in the desert\\\" and \\\"ice\\\" were somewhat similar in the way their universes felt like, futuristic societies with enhanced individuals in a scenario where we stretched too far in the galaxy and people are after bizarre things that might get them killed. two of my favourite episodes are in this category, namely those that aren't \\\"ice\\\". \\\"ice\\\" wasn't awful, but it was very anticlimactic, i believe it means to illustrate an example of injustice within the given system, however hard you try in a society with enhanced individuals as a non-enhanced, you will still be an outcast even when you are successful. alright, fair point, injustice occurs in all societies and often they are similarly absurd, but just showing the sheer exclusion of a person from beginning to end without giving a kernel of idea as to what change could occur in this society is unfair to the viewer who is spending their time and money to watch this, it's not that i expect a catharsis at the end of anything i watch, but this one was just so disappointingly hopeless and hollow.\\\"the tall grass\\\", \\\"all through the house\\\" & \\\"the drowned giant\\\"\\nthree episodes on weird, unknown, creepy creature(s) - i think \\\"the drowned giant\\\" episode was unique on its own, i'll come back to that. but first, these three were the only ones that didn't take place in a futuristic or dystopian setting. i'll admit, i expect this show to present prospective instances of the far or near future, but one of my favourite episodes from the previous chapter took place in the post-war ussr, so i always have high expectations for the contemporary content in the series as well. \\\"the tall grass\\\" and \\\"all through the house\\\" did not fully meet my expectations, but they were unique in their own way and were enjoyable to watch, although i still find it repetitive to have two similarly constructed episodes, around the mystery of a dangerous creature that they survive due to a metaphorical(being good) or a direct(the conductor) deus ex machina, as i said, this is a general shortcoming for this entire volume. speaking for myself, \\\"the drowned giant\\\" was the most interesting episode in this volume, it wasn't my favourite, but it was different from all the others, it did include a giant, which does fit the unknown, weird creature description, but it was never about the giant itself, it was the idea that the giant represented for the narrator\\u002fscientist character and what it represented to the rest of the people in their society. it was the elephant in the room, society was triumphant over it, over their fear of the idea of a colossal monster, whilst the narrator was simply curious, wistful. it was the undeserved victory of a collective mind and the personal desire to understand the unknown. in the end, it was just a memory, both for the narrator and the people, we watched the creation of a larger-than-life memory, a myth, a story from the older times.this is all the rambling from me folks, i realize i spent more time on some episodes than the others, please approach this as nothing more than a random guy's random opinions on something he could never create himself. cheers.\",\"very high is quality!\\nps: with less violence it would be perfect\",\"the first two seasons were good. the third started great. then, they went with that ubiquitous leftist propaganda about a number of themes (gender, euthanasia, supposed racial discrimination). i can't understand this urge for politics. the series is now trash.\",\"this show is absolutely brilliant. there are only a few episodes out of all the seasons that were a little odd but overall the show is amazing! dark and mysterious every disposes leaves you wondering about those twists endings. always and favorite and easy to rewatch\",\"i was browsing through netflix and spotted this title. it mentioned robots and i like those so i thought, \\\"why not?\\\" and i am so very glad i did! it was not what i was expecting at all.comparisons to the animatrix are well founded and, after watching a few of the animations, it was exactly what came to my mind as well. another film it brought to my mind was \\\"the abc's of death\\\" as it shared the same kind of genre hopping content, even though abcod was purely a horror film.each episode is a short story lasting around 15-20 minutes on average. they cross a number of genres from sci-fi to comedy and straight up horror. all are strikingly animated and, at times, the animation is so good that it's easy to forget you're not actually looking at flesh and blood people. i think there were actually only a couple of stories where i didn't like the animation, but this was more down to my personal taste i think.the stories themselves are well written and there isn't really a weak one in the bunch. again, there were a couple which i didn't enjoy as much which was more about my own likes and dislikes than anything they did wrong but, the great thing about an anthology, is you don't have to wait very long for another one to come along.a quick word about the 18 rating. it absolutely deserves that classification as the violence can be quite startling at times in how graphic it can be. similarly, when you get to the sex part of the title, this series pulls no punches whatsoever, as it is just as graphic as the violence i.e. it doesn't shy away from detail! so, not the kind of cartoon you can settle your kids down in front of. likewise, don't sit down to watch it with your nan, because explaining exactly what's going on may prove to be rather uncomfortable (unless your nan is very broadminded.)so, recommended? absolutely, just make sure your kids and elderly relatives are well out of harms way!\",\"this is why i pay for netflix!

happened to this show?? seasons 1-3 were brilliant. and it went downhill from there. we finally get a season 6 and it's just horrible. like why are the episodes so gory and violent now? they're trying too hard to be a horror show now and losing the whole theme of the show - which is how technology will mess is up... hence the title 'black mirror' (seeing your reflection on a blank device screen).i'm starting to think that they got interfered by higher ups (like much higher up) for showcasing technology that actually exists or in the works, and stopping them from showing it to prevent people from causing backlash when those technologies come more mainstream on the population.in season 6, episode 1 was decent because it's a good point to actually read what these big tech companies are putting in their t&c's. and episode 2 was ok, because society glorifies true crime content. but the rest were just random and garbage.they shouldn't have brought the show back if they aren't going to stay true to their theme.\",\"i simply love this show. it's a thinking mans twilight zone and i look forward the new season every year.\\ni have just found out netflix have cancelled the show and

darker aspects of humanity and society.\",\"no. not even going to bother. too much to complain about\",\"while the animation and cgi are consistently entertaining and at times impressive, the story

sci-fi-infused sex, violence, and gore. except now, production values are substantially enhanced via modern cgi and technology.my favorite episodes: suits, good hunting, zima blue, and alternate histories. otherwise, the quality varies with violence and gore substituting for story and characterization.if you are like me a big fan of sci-fi animation as i am you know that if you spend enough time cruising vimeo and youtube you can discover a lot of really clever and imaginative sci-fi and fantasy short films. what love, death & robots does is put together a bunch in an easily binge-able collection. still, i must admit my interest in endless chases and gratuitous violence and cruelty has diminished over the years. nowadays my interests are more attuned to creativity, cleverness,

animated series that showcases the power of storytelling in the modern era. it is not merely a narrative but an exploration of profound meanings related to daily life and the advancements of technology in today's world. each episode in this series is unique, which is what makes it so captivating.one of the highlights that captivated me is the use of dark humor that allows us to laugh and feel unsettled simultaneously. situations that may seem ordinary in everyday life turn into comedic and thought-provoking moments, all through exceptional production and beautiful animation. we can deeply understand the creative process and see the dedication of the team in every detail.in each episode, i felt a different emotional flavor, whether it was excitement, sadness, or even humor, making the viewing experience feel fresh and exhilarating every time. furthermore, the sound design and audio techniques are remarkable, serving as an element that enhances the atmosphere and emotions in each episode seamlessly.the dialogue in this series is insightful and engaging, with storytelling that never feels tedious. each episode offers distinct selling points but manages to connect them beautifully. the social and political satire, alongside technological commentary, prompts us to question the world we live in, making it clear that this series is a must-watch.ultimately, i am excitedly awaiting the next season of love, death & robots. it is not just an ordinary animated series but a bold piece of art filled with creativity that i believe everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime!\",\"relay very good series. different stories, ideas and creating approach. every single episode it's a complete story with a picture which bests suit for representing of

have forgotten who invented concentration camps and mass genocide on a racial or cultural basis.\",\"binged it all now i need more. epic and so unique. three robots is absolutely jokes\",\"the anthology series is based on the premise that in the futuristic world where despite mind blowing high-tech stuff, humans still end up more miserable than they were before. it makes you question (you know similar to whether robots are good, aliens are friends?) whether we want that kind of \\\"cool\\\" or seemingly interesting techs around us.if you can digest the above premise than you are in for a heck of a ride. the writing & cast is so brilliant, you get immersed in each episode almost as if living in that world. the series delivers episode after episode its dark thrilling tales that gets

shocked about the negative reviews it received. i'm going to be honest, it wasn't what i expected but that doesn't make it bad. it was very dark, and very shocking; had me completely on the edge of my seat throughout. you will have to watch it with an open mind as it is somewhat distasteful and well... extremely far-fetched (which is pretty absurd for a satire, but i digress.) i did thoroughly enjoy it however, it hit all the right notes.after watching the second episode, i was left in shock about the jarring contrast from the first episode. it's so different than the prior, it's set in an alternate reality and is just.. unusual. still dark, still intriguing, but didn't quite capture my imagination the way the first one did.the third and final instalment was probably my favourite of the 3. it was again, completely unrelated from the previous 2, but it had a really interesting concept and narrative, and was executed phenomenally. all in all, the series as a whole is very interesting,

rolled into one. which is what it makes it so good.basically black mirror premise is to dive into (very plausible) scenarios into where technological progress may lead us if we are not careful, and just how f-ed of a world we may end up with it.would recommend watching all of the episodes, and it is a perfect show to watch if you feel like watching something but maybe do not have time to watch a

shorts.\",\"movies should be art, not political propaganda. 15 mins into the first episode and i saw everything - man bashing, lesbian action, fight the power... the only thing missing was \\\"orange man bad!\\\" line.\",\"epicif you like unique narratives that will play on every emotion... this is the show for you\",\"it's a very long time ago, that i could watch such a nice stuff. high quality made pieces, never boring, simply astonishing. i want more of this!!\",\"i hate this show. episodes have been recommended to me by ethics teachers, friends, family and the entire internet. knowing every epsiode is different i've given each one a chance.from nosedive, to ashley too, to shut up and dance, i've hated every single one. they are boring, predictable, drag on forever, pretentious, and the philosophical ideas presented are so basic you could show them to a bunch of preschoolers and they'd understand perfectly well. most epsiodes come with a \\\"twist\\\" that you see coming from a mile away and is presented as way more dramatic than it really is.i seriously cannot understand the hype over this. if anyone recommends this to me, i can't take any other recommendations they might have seriously ever again.\",\"black mirror is definitely a well thought out series of different movies in each episode, which is definitely thought provoking; although it can get quite dark.would love to see an episode, on world war 3, or what would happen if all the nuclear went off.\",\"this is by far one of the most captivating series of short animations i have watched. aesthetic, and flawless. hope twenty more seasons will come out; most certainly there are more number of brilliant writers out there to be discovered to contribute to such plethora of traumatizingly beautiful pieces.\",\"this show has some deep meanings.. i mean i'd say the majority of the episodes from all seasons have a really good message and or it just makes you think about things or the society that we live in. some episodes are wayyyyyy out there but i didn't mind that at all. if you like sort of weird quirky shows this show would be perfect for you.\",\"it's weird, it's different, it's unique which makes it enjoyable.\",\"it's not a singular show so much as it is a collection of shows with no cohesion amongst eachother. i wouldn't be surprised if this thing was just a marketing gimmick to test what audiences were interested in the most for future potential productions. however the quality, wildly different artstyles, and vastly different story topics means that it's not necessarily a show to binge-watch because it could be a little jarring from one episode to the next. i don't think i want the second season to continue any existing stories but instead have it's own batch of new ones.i will give a warning about a particular episode though, because apparently the order of the episodes might actually be random or in a different order for different people. personally speaking, \\\"sonnie's edge\\\" is probably the most disappointing thing i've ever watched because it has so much potential that gets thoroughly wasted.it had everything going for it and could have been a pilot for a whole new series. one of the most interesting settings and concepts i've seen in a long while and in a particular style with great animation that fits it perfectly. immediately pulled into the world and wanted to see more of it unfold... but then oh dear god. it literally feels like it was written by an over-active twitter user who failed highschool english class. every single facet of the writing is below bottom-tier and it decides to double-down when it has the chance to recover. my disappointment was immeasurable, and my day was ruined.\",\"i watched the first episode and lost precious minutes of my life. boring, un-interesting are the words that come to mind.please avoid better see porn that this utter hideos series. of course, i am judging by one episode... and i do not believe it can get better\",\"edit (season 3 - 5 stars):\\nfor me this is without question the weakest season of all three..the animation work continues to deserve high praise, not only that but i recently learned that different episodes are designed by different animation studios all over the world, which is amazing news!regardless if i am into the animation or not (some is really bad in my opinion), it goes without saying that the work is incredible overall, i continue to be stunned by the ultra realistic ones!but the stories for this season are heavily focus on one genre mostly: horror. of course personally that is not the most appealing one for me, so not to be unfair and rate it only due to the genre i feel that a ton of episodes display a lot of gore and violence and there's no much goal to it... i don't mind the violence but i don't like the cheap one either, there is no clear goal for the ridiculous gore and it just makes it uncomfortable and macabre.i am more of a fan when they mix the sci-fi with mystery and sure a pinch of horror but not as intense as they did on this one, i didn't enjoy it for the most part i merely appreciated the animation.looking forward to see what they do next hope they shift their approach.-------------------------------------season 1 and 2 (7.5 stars)i've seen both seasons at this point and one thing i can say for sure - this is the most amazing animated work in shows \\u002f movies i have ever seen.in some of the episodes the animation is so freakishly realistic that in some shots you have a hard time distinguishing if it's animated or actually real!so speaking in visual effects and animation for the most part it's easily a 10, the problem is the animation isn't enough...\\nthis is an anthology series so each episode has a different set and story completely unrelated with each other, the genre can vary a lot, it can be drama, comedy or horror and even though it's short stories some of them have thought provoking and shocking messages.usually i love the realistic ones not only the animation but it's story, some i don't like the animation at all and others the story is just weak or vulgar and this is why is so difficult to rate the show.there are very few episodes that perfectly balance amazing animation and original story, there a lot that seem kind of random or exaggerated and not so good, so i guess my rating would be an average of all the episodes.\",\"i heard good reviews until i've watched it myself. this is beyond greatness.. animation, story, acting, characters, soundtrack, everything in it such a masterpiece.\",\"my hopes and dreams related to the new season of this masterpiece have been crushed, spat on and annihilated by every second of it . the issues showcased in every episode of bm se04 are just plain dumb, do not take into consideration common sense, humane instincts, are diminishing the grandeur of science and in fact neglect the directions of scientific evolution. sadly i would not recommend the latest season to anyone. \\npainful to watch.this is all in contrast to seasons 1-3 to be exact.\",\"its an obvious 10\\u002f10. no ep has ever disappointed me. each ep is so well written and unique. it brings us face to face with the reality of the society which we live in. it exposes our mentality towards each other and warns us about the future. i have never seen a scifi show this good. u can also watch love death robots after this. it is also good, but not better than this, and more random. but black mirror is a must watch for scifi lovers.\",\"overall, it's a great production, except for a few fiasco episodes (two in season 5). unique in its field.the actors in the series performed very well, although they were not famous. the sights, sounds and atmospheres created were great. it is necessary to congratulate the writers separately. i've said over and over again, \\\"how can you think of such marginal issues!\\\" until season 5, the series had a philosophy created. if they don't leave this, the 6th season can still leave my mouth open.i think it is a very special production. that's why it's a 10-star series.\",\"ldr is an anthology show like twilight zone or black mirror or outer limits. there's a heavy sci-fi emphasis, just like in those shows, though ldr is quite heavily biased in favor of animated shorts. i feel like the first season did have a few live action episodes, but i might be misremembering.the animation can vary from cartoony, to 'uncanny valley' level photorealistic with rather alot of realistic caricatures in between. it's usually very good animation, but often there are lip-synching problems, motion problems, and other things that bring the experience down a notch...but still, quite good and in such a wide range of styles that the whole thing feels very experimental and boundary pushing. so i forgive all of that.what i'm less inclined to forgive is story. far too many of ldr's shorts come down to 'monster scary, monster hunt human, humans die with as much gore as we can fit on the screen'. which...okay. that's fine. but do we really need so much of it? i haven't done a survey, but i will bet that between a third and half of the episodes fit into just random monster stories. which is way more than is interesting.further, part of the cool of a sci-fi anthology show is really exploring the ramifications of some weird concept or idea that couldn't support a whole movie, but can support one really thought-provoking episode of a tv show. and there are some of those in here. just...not enough. this feels less like twilight zone or black mirror and more like american horror story where the arcs are single episodes instead of full seasons. i feel like just saying 'congratulations, you can animate blood and gore. whoopdie doo. can we actually insert some story or character too?'honestly, most of the best episodes are front-loaded in the first season. i'm not saying all. but most. it's also the largest season.\",\"short snapy and fullfilling.\\neach episode sets it´s own tune, and you kinda want to keep watching.10\\u002f10\",\"definitely waiting for more! had a great suspense and good way of connecting episodes in last episode of season 4\",\"black mirror is a british science fiction anthology television series created by charlie brooker. each episode of the series presents a standalone story that explores the darker aspects of modern society, particularly the unanticipated consequences of the use of technology in our daily lives. the show explores various themes such as the impact of technology on society, privacy, surveillance, and human nature.the series is known for its dark and disturbing tone, and its ability to take a thought-provoking look at the ways in which technology is shaping our world. the show's episodes are diverse in terms of genre, tone, and style, with some episodes being more comedic and others being more dramatic and suspenseful.the acting in the series is also noteworthy, with a talented ensemble cast that delivers strong performances in each episode. the writing is also exceptional, with well-crafted and thought-provoking storylines that keep the audience engaged and thinking long after the episode has ended.one of the criticisms that could be made about the series is that some episodes are stronger than others, and some may not resonate with all audiences. additionally, the series can be quite dark and disturbing, which may not be suitable for all viewers.overall, i would recommend black mirror for fans of science fiction, anthology series, and those looking for a thought-provoking and thought-provoking series that explores the darker aspects of modern society and the impact of technology on our lives. the show's diverse episodes, talented ensemble cast, and well-crafted storylines make it a must-watch series. it's a unique and captivating series that keeps the audience thinking long after the episode has ended.\",\"this show is like the twilight zone on steroids. after every episode i feel really shaken up. there have been very few shows or movies that have had this kind of effect on me in recent years.\",\"this is probably the best animated series i've ever saw. the mix of different stories was a no brainer considering the short episodes, which makes you want to watch more and more since every episode is more or less 10\\u002f10. 👍👍👍\",\"why makers wanted to show only this? why it should always have a sad and terrible ending which we can can't even bear. this show literally makes us feel so bad being a human as it always concentrates on the darkest side of human with inhumane scenes. seriously disappointing and depressing series till date but though the concept and idea execution is exceptional. but still what is the purpose of a story telling when you are deciding that it's gone go so bad that nothing is going to save you and this is how it ends. any story should give us a sense of hope not just crap of society with a disturbing ending.\",\"so good i actually made my first imdb review. need more. won't overdescribe it.\",\"1\\u002f1\\u002f18. have seen all 4 seasons of this technology-based series. overall it's pretty good. however, i loved san junipero the best. almost didn't get through the first season without watching several episodes again. the seasons have gotten better, so that i liked more episodes than not. season 4 was probably the best, in which i liked 4 out of 6. there is no continuity, so each episode pretty much stands on its own and requires you to start all over again. like twilight zone, but the episodes are longer.\",\"almost every episode leaves you with an \\\"oh my god... what just happened..?\\\"\\nthe one with the yoghurt was a bit boring but the rest was funny, sexy or gruesomely mindblowing.\\ni love the fact that every episode has its own animation style.\\nwell played netflix, keep 'em coming!\",\"i just went through a mind blowing animation ecstasy. i think they were creative masterpieces of visuals and animations, sound and script. i am overjoyed. i can't help but sign in and leave a review for the series. i am a fan!\",\"i am impressed how they can make these short episodes feel so much longer. there is so much depth to each one.\\nreminds me of neil blomkamp's oats studios, check that out (on youtube) if you liked ldr for sure. very gory, very sci-fi, even has a \\\"god\\\" mini-verse thing.\\nanyways, the animation\\u002fcgi in ldr is top notch, felt like i was tripping at times. i feel like they went a bit overboard on the violence but maybe i'm getting more sensitive to all that. still it takes animal cruelty videos or snuff clips to make most sick, and i felt sick a few times watching some scenes.\\nthat being said not all episodes are violent, goes at a great pace if you decide to watch it all at once.\\nthe best for me were \\\"lucky 13\\\", \\\"good hunting\\\", \\\"sucker of souls\\\", \\\"secret war\\\", and \\\"ice age\\\", but honestly they're all great. 10\\u002f10 keep 'em comin'\",\"no other show on earth has ever made me feel so disgusted and upset but then can't wait to binge the rest! absolutely brilliant! i wish they made more of them, there are so many other things to write about so i know that is not a problem , the problem is netflix and

not one for reviews so this will be short and to the point. it's true what another reviewer said.. once you start watching you just can't stop! the only gripe is that each episode is very short and

was so badass.\\nlast season was just ridiculously disappointing. 1 star\",\"the first season had so much variety, nuance, and thought provoking material, plus gorgeous animation. the second season was awful and almost totally forgettable.\",\"great animation, stories, and uniqueness. about time netflix put something good on again.\",\"i've been complaining about that why they don't use pixar tech on movies beside animations for children. finally they have done it. i congrats netflix for this and roma. they do really good and leading job.\",\"in general, i love the concept of offering an outlet for animated shorts that is quite flexible. but while this series delivers some amazing pieces, it also delivers top tier trash.really, you should review those episodes one by one. there are some really nice stories, zima blue being my favorite. but there are quite a few episodes that feel like graphic demos, studios promoting how good they can make stuff look, but lacking anything else. they feel shallow and dont bring anything new to the table. to give a reference of how much my rating would vary between episodes: 9-10 for the best and probably 2 for the worst.i would say i liked about 40% of the episodes in season one, that may be a low score, but at least those were really refreshing. so in total, i enjoyed season one, i wasnt blown away because some stories drag the overall experience a bit down. i was excited to see a second season.season two underdelivers. not only are there only half as many episodes, they are also shorter and worse in overall quality. only one story did i actually like, two others were okay-ish, the rest was bad.update\\u002fedit season 3: same principles as before apply, many episodes feel like graphic demos. i don't even want to count the number of episodes that basically follow the plot \\\"soldier squad on their own, killing some monsters\\\" just in different settings. but overall i liked season 3 more than the second. it was almost worth watching. perhaps a sign that season 4 might be good again? i certainly hope!rating for season 1: 7-8\\nrating for season 2: 3\\nrating for season 3: 5.\",\"season 1 was unique. i must say season 2 was a disappointment for me.\",\"normally, with an anthology, you get one or two really good episodes, a mediocre bunch and then one or two that stink, but i was pleasantly surprised by love, death & robots. out of all the episodes, there were only two that i thought to be mediocre and the rest were outstanding. i ended up binging the whole thing in one night and was wanting more.\",\"love - check.\\ndeath - bloody check.\\nrobots - big metal check.\\nabsolutely recommend it. i'm surprised how vfx gone far.\",\"watching love, death & robots was like watching an animated version of black mirror, only shorter, darker and with more adult theme. every episodes are of beautiful animation and have excellent short story line. i only wish the episodes are much longer cause i can't stop watching them!\",\"1st season was great. lots of love, death and robots.. 2nd season... meh.\",\"wow. just wow. love, death and robots is an amazing eye catching short story show that just wowed every second. for netflix's first nsfw show, it really delivered and this will for sure set a path for future shows like this down the road. love love love! ❤\",\"just as i was tired of all the futuristic dystopias whether the world is ruled by robots, everybody became fat and lazy, or resources are over and people are fighting for food, i came across this beautiful tv series, instead of making people fear from what is already terrifying such as world hunger or short life expectancy, this show takes everything you love about the future, from artificial intelligence to nanotechnology and lets you see how it can go all wrong, and how it is more terrifying than evil robots destroying your home.\",\"season 3 did not disappoint. the animation in some of the stories is so lifelike. especially, jibaro!\\\"night of the mini dead\\\" is hilarious. and i liked the ideas portrayed in \\\"bad traveling\\\" and \\\"in vaulted halls entombed.\\\"\\nlove death & robots seems to have become a benchmark for animation. jibaro went beyond all my expectations. the dancelike movements, intricate details of the location, and the soundtrack all made it a great watch.can't wait for the next season.\",\"every episode reminded me of exactly what it is i love about animated shorts and movies. the writing was excellent. the humor spot on and the action sequences absolute nail biters all. i would have gladly paid theater admission to see that on the big screen. and each and every episode was pure art. i can't say enough about this series. dear lord come out please let them make a season 2!\",\"netflix setting the bar in outer space.\\nbrilliant!\",\"each episode is like a brilliantly animated short film with a unique animation style, and each season packs different genres. some episodes like zima blue and the witness have stunning visuals, some have a deep, profound meaning masked under the curtain of a shallow, straightforward story, some are thought-provoking, while others are just good old action-packed thrillers.what pleases me is that despite the gruesome and often dark themes in some episodes, none are actually that heavy on your mind and don't leave you feeling awful, as some movies or shows do. the short episodes are also perfect for people with short attention spans who have trouble keeping up with everything that goes on in a 1.5hr+ movie. very entertaining overall.\",\"this show provides a thought-provoking look into the dark side of technology. many episodes are set in the plausible near-future, with some of the technologies actually not too far off from real-world current technologies.some of the episodes are kind of dark, but they end up doing a great job of provoking thought. i found myself asking, \\\"what would i do in that situation?\\\"\\nthrilling, suspenseful, very well acted, well written. would highly recommend!!imdb needs to fix their app for submitting a review.\",\"it is most likely the best western animated series to come out in a long time. most episodes will leave you begging for a full feature film. the variety of diverse stories, types of animations and the characters that this sci-fi series engulfs is actually mind-blowing! not a single boring episode. i mean if you do get bored, you can always skip the episode because they are all standalone. not that i ever skipped one.this is not to say that improvements can't be made... need more episodes!western animations always lacked the experimental aspect of making an animated show. they just don't like taking risk anymore. big studios always produced stuff that are sure to be a hit with the average joe. kudos to netflix for getting this show up and running with all the blood and gore!\",\"dangerously creepy mind and bending experience every episode. among the greatest shows of our existence! many great realizations that people probably don't think about. i can think of a few people that can sit through & not take in the messages that represent our very existence in a metaphorical genius true way whether with technology, traumatic series of events, mind control, illusions, or being trapped in some way, which is unfortunate for those that aren't woke!regardless of woke or not, i'm happy this is available for people to immerse into the dark reality we live in. sci-fi episodes or not they have an extremely valid point to get across to the viewers. outstanding scary good grittiness all around; will always remain in my favorites.\",\"this series takes you to landscapes and cities that push the boundaries of imagination.honestly, i didn't expect it to be so good. although each story is short, it contains a world of its own wtih different concepts of life. a great series to watch.\",\"this show was one of my top favorite shows and a new season was definitely something to look forward to each year. episode 1 was good to start off the season, however episode 2 and 3 was not the best! episode 2 was just boring, and episode 3 with a few adjustments belonged on disney channel. so disappointing. the actors were great, the storyline however wasn't ! overall this season did not live up to black mirrors potential! i do encourage everyone to watch previous seasons though.\",\"as i started the first episode of this series i kept getting glitches\\u002fblinks of a pic from the john oliver show. and trump as the thumbnail in his background dialouge. the same pic continued to flash throughout the first 5 or 8 min before i began to realize this might not be part of the episode. to note i have been watching a lot of oliver among others on youtube like rogan, meyers, etc. but this was so strange that i actually thought it was part of the episode. i closed all my windows on in safari and it went away. thank god. i started to become paranoid yo!! and now i'm starting to think i have psychosis. although i'm a perfectly normal, albeit introspective, person. this show delivered lol. either way there was a little part of me that was thinking wow, this is really innovative as far as futuristic fiction goes. to be able to take from my other queries and insert them into an already weird new tv content series...\\nbrilliant or i am losing my mind or technology i can't keep up with. close all your other browsers people before you start watching this lol.\\ndisclaimer: no drugs were involved in this review!\",\"i'm split between rating volume one a 9 or 10\\u002f10 but then rating volume two at 2 or 3\\u002f10.volume one was amazing. i mean, beyond the aquila rift, sonnie's edge, the secret war... pure perfection. absolutely amazing. the characters, the plots, the twists, everything.then came volume 2. i just finished it and i'm disappointed. their was no point to any of it. some didn't even make sense. there were no plots, no twists, nothing thought provoking. you don't care about the characters. snow in the desert was by far the best episode of v2, but even that is only on par with an average episode from v1like someone else said, v2 felt more like projects from an ap video class then from a studio. hopefully a v3 will bring it back up.\",\"although i'd still say that this season is worth watching, i have to also say that it is most definitely nowhere near as good as season 1.first of all, stories of s2 are best described as \\\"meah\\\". aside from the e3 and e4 (that were somewhat interesting and\\\\or thought-provoking) and e6 that made me chuckle a bit, the rest are completely forgettable.second, this season seams to be positively muted in terms of sheer madness and creative scope of the first one. why this is would be anybody's guess, but my sense is that the network decided to play it safe instead of embracing the sometimes-provocative insanity of the first season.finally, this season contains less than half the number of episodes of the first one, why??? i get not being able to film real actors during the time of the pandemic, but what was stopping a bunch of it and cgi pros from creating a bunch of episodes while sitting comfortably in front of their computer screens at home...truly beyond me.so here we are, still enjoyable to watch, but doesn't even begin to hold a candle to the first season. what a shame, such a missed opportunity.\",\"i love one episode having no correlation to next allowing for so much creativity. using different animation from episode to episode to match the tone of the story is awesome. the length of the episodes isn't a problem either but i went through the show in one sitting. if the episodes are so short they could've made a few more or simply added a little more character building in some episodes. regardless i love watching and look forward to more.\",\"i must say from the start to the end amazing!! i love how each episode is different and takes you into a new light. very interesting movie with on point acting.\",\"finally a new season has arrived.i must say that most of the episodes remind me of video games and they are fewer than before.i loved the scenarios of the episodes but in my opinion season 1 are far better than 2 and i missed a lot of the old robot characters*\",\"the variety of different styles of animation shown throughout the series is impressive to say the least. there are some that are almost photo realistic and others that have a very unique visual aesthetic.for season 2 i'd love to seem them use the voice of glados for one if there animations.\",\"this is getting amazingly awesome by the minute,\\ncan't wait for volume four.exceptional detailed concept, demandes looking into the deeper layers of each episode.\",\"love, death and robots is an anthology series made by producers such as tim miller (deadpool) and david fincher (house of cards & fight club). each episode has a distinct style and tone due to outsourcing the work to many animation studios around the world. the episodes are short, averaging about 15 minutes each, but they each tell a story owning a different style and charm.love, death and robots does exactly what the title states, it explores themes of love and death while mixing robots in to suggest the overall genre will be sci-fi. the series is science-fiction in it's best form, exploring cyberpunk, to steampunk, to modern realism and even with fantasy mixed in as well. most of the episodes are adaptations of famous science-fiction authors such as john scalzi, peter f hamilton, alastair reynolds and more. hence, you know the story is rooted in capable hands. i thoroughly enjoyed love, death and robots. it's fun, weird and capable of subverting expectations. its beautiful animation can easily make up the series because it is both alluring and vivid. the mature style also stands out as animation rarely deviates from it's more child-friendly ratings, only these days we are getting more adult animation, as we have seen they can be an effective medium.not every episode maintains the previous episode's mood or tone, hence it's best to watch each episode as a digestible bite. some of the episodes have a different quality, but others might pique your captivation. hence, it's hard to objectively rate each episode as it boils down to personal preference and existing expectations. however, the overall experience of the series has been unique in exploring the boundaries of the medium and bolstering brilliant narratives. this is an exceptional series, made up largely by the sum of its parts. do check it out.\",\"same like all others here, after watching the first episode i coudn't stop until the end ! finished it in the same day\\ntim miller did a great job directing this and the cgi is simply mind-blowing\",\"and then its followed up by a second season which demonstrates how stupid, tasteless, and derivative the decision makers are. there are artists out there who can tell a story but they are stymied by the in-group of self serving connected people. emperor has no clothes, but unlimited funds to rip off other titles.\",\"season 1 has its ups and downs but it holds a very decent level.season 2 is less than half as long and much less than half as entertaining. most stories are painfully, painfully generic. only the animation remains. no need to explain more.8.5 s1.5 s2.\",\"less naked and ridiculous scenes would make it better\",\"enjoyable. raw. fun.netflix came out good with this one.\",\"we are faced with an incredibly creative anthology of 18 different stories ranging from an immense variety of animation designs, cinematography, music-sound use, and transhumanism to cyber punk, from robotics to artificial intelligence, from the life of others to anti-militarism: love, death & robots.it was obvious from the trailer that we would be watching interesting things, but i didn't expect that much. the taste of each episode remained in my palate. death, love & robots show the end point of the animation. cyberpunk, love, death, technology, apocalyptic, a variety of topics such as space is told. so each viewer can find something in the series. there were criticisms of sexism and violence, but i didn't encounter such a problem. episode lengths range from six to seventeen minutes. although it is a little short, you can understand the quality when you watch. 9\\u002f10\",\"i just finished the final episode and the standard was incredibly high from start to finish. very original, with some very intriguing and interesting plots that leaving you wanting more. the quality of the animation, from the traditional handdrawn, to the photo realistic cgi was breaktaking.\\ni hope really netflix produce something similar again. very very impressive.\",\"making this review to compare the first season to the second. the first season is almost perfection. most of its individual episodes have great stories and meaning behind them, they have originality. even the worst episodes in season one are watchable and have some level of entertainment. the first season has lots of re-watchability to it. but then they released the second season. it's got plenty of episodes with cool concepts but they drag on. i, and many other people, felt let-down by the subsequent season. so far it only has eight episodes, and those eight episodes feel like they were episodes cut from the first season. it isn't horrible, but once you see it all, you don't want to watch it again. its worst episodes are unbearable and its best are inferior compared to the first season. it contains episodes where the characters make dumb decisions, and its got plenty of episodes that are hard to understand.with all of that said, i'm giving it a 7\\u002f10 because the first season is so good. 9\\u002f10 for the first season and 5\\u002f10 for the second.\",\"less than 1\\u002f2 the previous season, not quite with the same peaks as a result. cmon netflix. don't be cheap.\",\"thing that strikes me about this show is that everything they show in every episode is possible in real life... the technology and the outcomes etcmind blowing and i think educational.\",\"i have been reading science fiction short stories for decades and always thought a fair amount could be great on the screen.i recognize two or three each season. they should do better research because about half of each season's episodes are lame. the good news is the other half are really good.animation is amazing for every story, though, so it makes it easier to suffer through a bad story.\",\"i do not use to write reviews, but this series is gold and a must-watch for everyone who hasn't watched this yet. it's a mix of sci-fi, black comedy and drama. it might be a sci-fi, with the majority of the episodes being sci-fi(except one or two), but you gonna enjoy it regardless. every episode is self-contained, so you can start from season 4 if you wish to but make yourself a favor and watch it lol.\\ni can name you many reasons to watch it, but one of my favorite reasons is that \\\"disturbed\\\" feeling that you get every time an episode ends!\",\"each episode is great in its own way. the anthology makes you want to see more, and the episodes are easy to get through. great show all around.\",\"this show is so fantastic thank you to all the creators and staff involved in making it because it really is an entertaining sci fi anthology story! i wish i could play so many of these episodes as video games because they build entire worlds in the span of 5-15 minutes. i do wish the episodes were longer and some of them might even get up to 25 min but they never feel long enough, but that is the point i suppose? there are so many animation styles, voices and actors that pop up that i truly think you can watch this with anyone who enjoys sci fi or fantasy stuff and give it a try, maybe under the influence? haha cause it can be a bit trippy.\",\"the first episode was amazing, they should do a whole series based on that chapter...\\none of the best netflix series...\",\"this series is a set of incredibly well crafted short stories, which is especially impressive given that the longest episode is no more than 25 minutes long. i cannot recommend this series enough. the only thing i feel 100% justified in criticizing is the need to have some form of nudity in every episode. sure there are the ones where it works to the betterment of the plot\\u002fsetting. but some of the episodes felt like they strictly had nudity just to fit the rating, not that i'm complaining or anything, but i feel like it takes away from some of the stories when every time you see someone in a conversation, they're completely or majoritively naked.\",\"overall an entertaining, visually fascinating anthology. some really amazing action scenes, characters, and stories. the unique animation styles alone makes it worth checking out. character development is not a major issue, they do a good job there with what little time each episode has. most episodes do a good job with plot.unfortunately, the series does contain biased political messages, amateur writing\\u002fdialogue, and \\\"forced\\\" adult material. for some moments, it seemed like the creators relied solely on sex and violence to distract the viewers from how sub-par everything else was about the episode. in other words, the \\\"adult\\\" content was a hit and miss.one thing for sure, each episode is completely different; animation styles, themes, stories, characters, plots, emotions, are never replicated. really the only element all episodes share, is the genre of science fiction. it's a fantastic start to an animated anthology series, and let's hope that not only we get more seasons after this, but it continues to get better, as there is room for improvement.episodic review:1st episode (sonnie's edge): amazing animation, cool creatures, a sweet creature fight, engaging story with an awesome ending. heavy misandristic\\u002ffeminism vibes, however. aside from that, one can tell a lot of heart, thought, and work went into this short. good one to start the season, and the series with. 8\\u002f10\\nmain genres\\u002ftone: sci-fi\\u002faction\\u002fdrama, serious\\nmature content: violence, blood\\u002fgore, profanity, and nudity.2nd episode (three robots): way too political to enjoy. anti-theistic, anti-human, there were some good jokes and funny moments, but some flat ones too. would be a good episode, if it weren't for all the subtle\\u002funsubtle far-left messages and forgettable jokes. 3\\u002f10\\nmain genres\\u002ftone: sci-fi\\u002fcomedy, humorous\\nmature content: profanity3rd episode (the witness): reminds me of an ultra-violent eye-rape anime called \\\"dead leaves,\\\" only with a serious tone instead of a humorous one. plot is engaging at first with good potential, but ends up being too stylized, confusing and conceited, with over-the-top nudity. even the flashy, exotic animation couldn't save this one. fun visuals, pass on almost everything else. 4\\u002f10\\nmain genres\\u002ftones: sci-fi\\u002faction\\u002fthriller, upbeat & serious\\nmature content: violence, blood, profanity, and nudity.4th episode (suits): weak writing, and the animation comes off as \\\"rushed.\\\" still, a likable episode. love the half-life 2 crab-like creatures. 6.5\\u002f10\\nmain genres\\u002ftones: sci-fi\\u002faction, lightly serious with bits of humor\\nmature content: violence, blood, profanity5th episode (sucker of souls): the animation style seems to be a tribute to violent 90's anime. cool story, witty well-placed humor, with twisted horror elements makes this one so far one of the best, especially for horror fans. especially enjoyed the new spin on an old, familiar horror villain icon, and the element of kitties. makes up for the trite, cats-are-evil concept that a certain earlier episode embraced. only complaints are with the ending: not much resolve, and it reveals a plot hole or two. 8.5\\u002f10\\nmain genres\\u002ftones: sci-fi\\u002fhorror\\u002faction\\u002fcomedy\\u002ffantasy, balanced mix of horror & comedy\\nmature content: heavy violence, blood\\u002fgore, profanity, light nudity.6th episode (when the yogurt took over): this narrated short has animation similar to pixar, starts off interesting enough, but just ends on a question mark. with more time to establish a structured plot, it may be a sufficient enough ending, but this one just leaves audiences scratching their heads. a bit humorous and silly, mostly just bland. 5\\u002f10\\nmain genres\\u002ftones: sci-fi\\u002fcomedy\\u002fdrama, comedy & potential satire\\nmature content: some cartoony nudity & brief violence7th episode (beyond the aquila rift): one of the most impressive and realistic animation styles, it's a lot like a lot of popular sci-fi mind-bending thrillers all shoved into a few minutes. keeps audiences guessing until the end...a very creepy, unsettling, gnarly end. it's like if the characters in the game series \\\"mass effect\\\" had an \\\"oopsie\\\" during a mass relay. super cool short. 9\\u002f10\\nmain genres\\u002ftones: sci-fi\\u002fdrama\\u002fthriller, serious\\nmature content: light violence, moderate language, nudity & sex, some disturbing imagery8th episode (good hunting): with an animation style very similar to \\\"the iron giant,\\\" this episode dives into japanese mythology, while mixing together the industrial revolution and robotics, with a sort of steam-punk feel. this gets my vote as saddest episode, as the story between the son of a spirit hunter forms a bond with a shapeshifting magical girl. it's a story of loss, protection, revenge, love, and coping with change. wonderfully animated, emotional tale. yet again though, almost ruined by unnecessary and distracting nudity. 8\\u002f10\\nmain genres\\u002ftones: sci-fi\\u002fdrama\\u002ffantasy, serious\\nmature content: some profanity, moderate violence & blood, heavy nudity (male & female)more to come\",\"the first season was so clever and experimental and interesting. tons of episodes and all offering something new. with exception to a couple episodes, it was a near masterpiece. then came season 2 which was straight garbage with maybe 3 episodes being ok and the others being basically just a ripoff of those episodes. then came season 3 which is really just another bland wokist snore fest we've seen over and over and over again. netflix got their grips in it and apparently doubled down from the mistakes of season 2. pay attention netflix, this is why you're quickly going bankrupt. bleh.\",\"love death & robots is a bundle of incredible story telling and impeccable animation. i have never seen so much talent and effort put into any show, as each and every episode is a true masterpiece. it covers relevant topics and makes you feel all kinds of things, and is guaranteed to leave you wanting more!\",\"and had a child. this series is fantastic. if you are too young, go back and watch heavy metal from 1981. way ahead of it's time. this reminds me a lot of that.\",\"this british play is really powerful. each episode can make a big reversal of people's psychological defense line. it slowly mingles with the people in the story. at last, i feel the sadness of modern high technology, especially the kidnapping in the first episode. the irony is too dark. it lets you examine all kinds of addictions brought by yourself and modern technology. at last, it even satirizes you, and you will still take pictures exclaimed with both hands.\",\"while the animations is quite lovely, most of the stories, with the exception of lucky 13 and alternate history, are tired takes on ideas that have been done many, many times before. if one is going to grab an idea and re-do it, at least add some originality. and at least have an ending, not just roll to a jarring stop. if there's a second season, do a little better in the writing.\",\"honestly it just appeared on netflix so i thought why not give it a try? and i am so happy i did. every episode is so beautifully animated and the stories keep you interested from beginning to end! the most impressive and immersive thing netflix has done in a little while, you aren't wasting you're time. believe me.\",\"it's a shame that i can only review the two seasons bundled together.season 1 is absolutely fantastic. even the episodes that i enjoyed less have a story and something to make you think about. great stuff, really! graphic is great, many different styles.season 2 is trash. none of the 8 episodes has any merit whatsoever. the episodes are way too short, they have but a basic (often cliche) idea and even that doesn't get unfolded. graphic is of course great but it's mainly game-like 3d (showing a rendered face from up close is apparently the rage). a huge let-down after season 1. i'm shocked that critics love s2 so much.season 1: 10\\nseason 2: 1\\naverage: 5.5 (rounded up to 6)\",\"every episode so far is visually and story wise breathtaking!\",\"the first season is just amazing but the second season? meh.\",\"i loved s1! it was the only title that never removed from \\\"my list\\\" even though i watch it almost 2 years ago.now i am in the middle of s2, taking time between episodes, just because i want to last longer :)\\nthe stories, the different types of animation technics, the whole approach to this creation is mind blowing!as a kid i loved books with strange, short stories and series like the twilight zone.in addition to my love to comics, ld&r is an exhibition of all these combined.not all stories are great but each one of the viewers will find different stories to love. this variety is what makes it even more interesting! i don't know what to expect in every episode and there is something there for every taste.of course i would love to see few, if not all stories, longer but this is not the point.the photorealistic animation is great and i absolutely loved stories like the secret war, the witness and the snow in desert.i didn't like few of the stories but i enjoyed them all. even with the stories i didn't like much a second view uncovers new details and things that stand out.for all the animation lovers, comic enthusiasts, mystery and sci-fi fans, ld&r is a must!the 9\\u002f10 is a great rate for me. my 10 goes to a very small club of movies and series i've watched.\",\"this series has something for everyone. while not every episode \\\"tickles my fancy\\\" this series contains something for everyone. the stories are diverse, intriguing, exciting, beautiful. i can not recommend this enough to anyone that has at least the slightest interest to cinematography and storytelling. a true masterpiece.\",\"i read all the reviews and started to watch s1e1, the pm and the pig, all i can say this was stupid. however s1e2 was slightly better and then s1s3 - s4 all the episodes were amazing so stick with this or just start watching from s1e3.\",\"al you need to know:season 1: amazing, stunning animation and some very good stories (my favourite is lucky 13).season 2: good, pretty simple animation and none very good story, just some good ones.season 3: delusional, simple animation (animation of season 1 was better, in my humble opinion) and just maybe three stories that were okay.sadly netflix uses to push on release the more the better, not checking the quality of the show. especially after seeing that the first season goes well. that's a shame, really.\",\"this show tells the stories of both today and tomorrow in the form of amazingly crafted animated shorts. all 18 episodes have a unique and refreshing animation style, which makes it sorta abstract. delving into issues from how we'll go extinct due to global warming to the war in afghanistan. while simultaneously exploring the world of fantasy and awe. i'd definitely want to see some of the episodes made into a series of their own.\",\"absolutely fantastic! a must-see for all sci-fi fans, with short stories ranging between 7-17 minutes in length. a great spiritual successor to a cult series; thank you tim miller for resurrecting the this spirit!\",\"i had no expectations starting this series nor had i any idea of what it was about. ever episode brings something new and always blows my mind away. at least for the first two seasons and the christmas special. this show brings out the worst aspects of the human race and blows it out of proportion. that is what makes this show so disturbing yet so entertaining. i am one who loves disturbing shows with an intelligent story, and this show is perfect. i like the fact that ever episode is independent from one another, this widens the reach of the show, being able to cover many topics and different aspects. the pacing is great, screenplay is wonderful and the direction is on point for the most part. with that being said, the third season was slightly disappointing. i'm not saying that the latest season was bad. it's just nowt as good as the previous seasons. i did not find the latest season (3rd season) as intelligent or as disturbing as the previous ones. however, it did improve in the direction and the screenplay. overall, this is still one of m favorite series of all time.\",\"i enjoyed the first season quite a bit. beyond the aquila rift was probably the biggest standout for me, but almost all of the episodes were memorable, thought-provoking, captivating, or some combination of the three.by season two i was starting to get the sense that they were trying too hard to live up to the \\\"adult cartoon\\\" premise, with the superfluous gore or sex shoehorned into every episode often sticking out like a sore thumb.i didn't make it through season 3. the latest batch includes not one, but two episodes featuring oversized arthropods operating bloody human corpses like gastly meat puppets. whatever those episodes actually had to say - which wasn't much, to be honest - was overshadowed by the garish spectacle. i doubt that i'll still remember their plots at all by this time next year.and to be honest, those were two of the better episodes of the season. others were so paper-thin i've already forgotten what they were about - assuming they were about anything at all. but hey, it's a cartoon, only with blood and boobs and stuff. cooooool, so edgy.\",\"i want to echo the sentiment of a handful of reviewers here that this project gets respect for flash, but little for substance. by my episode 4 i had already come to the conclusion that this was just a modernized heavy metal, and then come to find out in the trivia section later that that's just exactly how this project was initially envisioned -- heavy metal 2.the problem is, in 1981, using animation to portray adult gore and sex was truly revolutionary. it was ground-breaking at a commercial scale, as only niche\\u002fbasement shops were even trying it. but now you have to buy special software to keep that sort of content from literally falling out of the internet onto your screens. the plots are just as uber-simple and shallow, lean just as too far on gore and sex than is needed to tell a story, and any twilight zone or outer limits episode can hold it's own to any of these stories concept wise.it's great to see what animation teams and studios can do without avatar budgets, don't get me wrong -- i'm happy to see the art form get a spotlight. but the producers forgot what decade they were in.\",\"this series impresses me most with its resplendent visual effects. the plots of most episodes are simple but \\\"magical\\\", with something either profound or amusing in behind. some of the sexual contents are unnecessary in my opinion, for example in \\\"the dump\\\".\",\"one of the best netflix originals .. i hope they will never stop production. one, two, three or even 10 seasons won't be enough. 😭😭😭😍😍😍\",\"this is truly an amazing show. at this point i have watched the first three episodes and have been brought to tears by each one. the issues that the show grapples with and illuminates in each episode are timely and significant. to say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison.\",\"i want more, i want the mini series to be full series.\\nespecially episode 2 and 4\",\"i really enjoyed this series. started watching and had to see all episodes. really good and i hope to see more series like this in the future.\",\"started the first episode just to see what it is all about.\\ncouple of hours later i command you to binge watch this , it's excellent\\nwell done netflix, we need more like this !\",\"i've watched a bunch of episodes, and i'm just not seeing what these high reviews are seeing. the stories range from boring to mildly interesting, and a lot are just plain confusing. they feel like b-roll pixar shorts.then there's the cursing and nudity. it would be interesting to see a show that doesn't go out of its way to avoid curses and full nudity, but this show takes it a step further, by just shoving the f-word and breasts everywhere it possibly can. it's almost like the animators were trying to distract from the lack of writing.\",\"season 1 was a good mix of decent stories and some duds, all built on the brilliant animation talents of every team behind the episode. season 2, however, offers only half the stories, and nothing with the same power of earlier episodes such as \\\"zima blue\\\". there are flashes of talent, but nothing that really pushes the boat out for me.season 2's best episodes are \\\"pop squad\\\", \\\"snow in the desert\\\" and \\\"the drowned giant\\\"; all great starting blocks, but don't do enough with their 15 minutes of screen time. the animation in the first two is second to none out there, and this technical proficiency is what actually makes the series stand out.unfortunately, the weaker episodes are borderline wastes of time. \\\"ice\\\" and \\\"automated customer support\\\" are just animation flexes, lacking any substantial plot or personal inspiration. this is exacerbated by the lack of episodes: only 8 after two years of production? this is a confusing downgrade from netflix, particularly since some studios must be clamouring for the opportunity to produce this sort of work.\\\"love, death and robots\\\" is a project i am a firm advocate of: it fills a market gap that sorely needs indie flare, whilst giving them the budget to flex their talent. having said this, the poor showing from season 2 does irk me, and makes it hard to really justify the experiment continuing too much longer.\",\"istantly hooked , each episode has its own style and theme but all have a great vibe , i could honestly watch a whole series of some of these episodes. amazing animation from realistic to the comic book style but often with horror or a ...nsfw style so definitely not for the kids ! i would love to see a sonnies edge series or good hunting or others tbh. confidence in netflix series reaffirmed.\",\"every season and episode the series go to the down.first episode in the first season is the best of the best.the last episode in the last season was the worst.\",\"spare me. when you're reviewing a series, can you please at least say if it's woke to spare people who have no interest in racism and sexism? this series is hard core.the first five minutes is how super strong women are, they're much stronger than men, they can beat up men and they need to do this because men are all oppressive.save your time. this is pure garbage by small minded people.if you really love sexism and racism and a lot of swearing, this ill suit you to a t. it's a substitute for solid story writing or thoughtful story.\",\"can someone explain to why literally every netflix original has to have a lgbt+ character? like just why??? i'm so sick of this garbage.\",\"1st season, incredible, but i liked some episodes more than others. 2nd season was just perfect. i saw some complaints of lack of story, well if you have a decent attention span that is not a problem and you will get it. less dialogue doesn't mean lack of story people. it makes when the characters do talk more impactful.\",\"i do not agree with the message for the most part, but most of the stories are thrilling. even tho not every episode is great most of them are really good.\",\"once i started i couldn't stop, god thing they were all shorts. the visuals on a few of these were amazing. beyond the aquila rift, lucky 13, and sonnie's edge were particularly well done, but they were all good. i certainly hope there's another season.\",\"the first season had mostly good episodes. second season had a few. third season was downright consistently weak. like unwatchable. and the last episode cemented that. what happened?\",\"i've just binged watched this entire series. fantastic!\",\"(updated after season 6).a series of independent stories, all centred around technology. is it a help or a hindrance?brilliant series, created and written by english comedian and social commentator charlie brooker. highly original in its concept - examining possible technological advances, and seeing how these could be used, or abused, and how they can help us, or be the bane of our existence. set at an everyday person level (mostly), so is highly engaging.plots are very intriguing and entertaining, drawing you in and keeping you locked in until the end. often part of the intrigue is figuring out the innovation depicted in the episode and how it works.in many of the earlier episodes, brooker was happy to just make the revelation of the innovation the punchline, and then just let the episode run its course from there. these were not bad episodes - the are no bad episodes (the worst score i gave to an individual episode was 7\\u002f10) - but did leave me a bit disappointed. i kept thinking this series was going to be like alfred hitchcock in the 21st (or 22nd) century and the lack of a great twist towards the end or powerful conclusion made me wonder what all the fuss was about.however, with time brooker's writing got better - grittier, more daring, more profound. he found his formula and pushed the envelope in terms of his creativity. while s2 e2 - white bear - was the first episode i gave a 10\\u002f10 to, it was really only from season 3 (starting with the brilliant christmas special between s2 and s3 - white christmas) where the series consistently delivered a punchiness to its endings. s3 e1 - nosedive - was one of the scariest and depressing imaginings of future social interaction i've ever seen...and it was 100% plausible.things then went from strength to strength. the pinnacle, for me, was s3 e6 - hated in the nation. a murder mystery combined with highly plausible technology, engaging, well-developed characters (well portrayed too) and a big swipe at social media and the types of people who inhabit it. you're forced to think about your own moral view on issues, while not being lectured as to what is the \\\"correct\\\" choice. brilliant episode.many aspects of the series give a damning, and quite relevant, view on society, and possibly where it is heading. it's not all doom and gloom though - there are some episodes that are quite upbeat, even romantic (san junipero, hang the dj) and in s4 e1 - uss callister - brooker makes use of his considerable comedic talent to deliver an episode that is wonderfully funny yet grippingly thrilling and action-filled.season 5 is a bit of a disappointment though. the plots are much more mainstream and less cerebral. there's flashes of the old black mirror but brooker never really rams the point home or provides something profound. very entertaining and still highly plausible but not of the same quality as the previous seasons.season 6 was a surprise in that followed more than four years after season 5 and most people, including myself, thought the show had finished. it follows largely in the same vein as season 5. episode 1 was more like the old black mirror but three of the five episodes are more horror-thriller orientated than the clever sci fi stuff of black mirror in its prime. all the episodes are still entertaining but, for the most part, the clever futurism of the earlier seasons has gone.season ratings: s1-4 9.5\\u002f10, s5 8\\u002f10, s6 7\\u002f10.\",\"definitely one of the best shows on netflix i've watched in a long time.theres comedy, theres action, great story telling.just wish the episodes were longer, but still, 100 percent worth giving a watch.\",\"i think netflix should carry more episodes this is ultimately badaaas series i had ever watch so damn good everyone should watch before dying\",\"season 3:\\nep. 1: garbage\\nep. 2: awesome\\nep. 3: meh\\nep. 4: interesting\\nep. 5: meh\\nep. 6: wasted potential\\nep. 7: refreshing\\nep. 8: wasted

although it had some great animations, as always.season 3 was in my opinion a bit better, but ultimately also forgettable experience with just a few good episodes that broke the trend of repeating the same two dystopian ideas. even those however failed to convey some thoughtful or original message and this show for me has become more of a collection of fun, quick animated stories, rather the smart and thought provoking show that we got in the first season.\",\"as someone else also wrote, season one was incredible. short stories with amazing open ended stories left for your imagination. out of the box concepts with great graphics.second 2 was a bit disappointing both in terms of storyline and concepts. it feels like it was released just for revenue or repeat customers. there was no reason to release such a lame season 2.\",\"this series has simply blown my mind. i dont tend to rave too much these days about television shows so if i do it's something that's really stirred me enough to want to say something.\\ni can't speak highly enough of this series. there's not one animated short i didn't love. there's a few stand outs but overall everyone was on point from the animation to the writing, each one delivers something unique and fresh.\\nstop what you're doing and watch this highly creative series, you won't be disappointed.\",\"fantastic cg animation with a variety of art styles on display, from very realistic to highly stylized. some interesting stories and characters, though a few episodes also had me yawning. season 1 might've been my favorite if only because they apparently either hired some more feminists or listened to their mindless criticism and decided to remove any appeal to the dreaded \\\"male gaze\\\" in the subsequent seasons. unfortunate since season 1 had a number of beautiful female characters, while seasons 2 and 3 are completely lacking. overall a decent show.\",\"exceptional 1st season, 2nd one a big disappointment!! no matter how you look at it.\",\"this series is super underrated, it always make you feel that whatever you anticipate for the next plot, the next plot will always surprise you, not redundant nor boring, it is simply

\\\"the witness\\\" and \\\"beyond the aquila rift, \\\"good hunting\\\" and \\\"zima blue\\\" the best. more, please, netflix!\",\"i loved the first season, it was a mix of great short films that drew you in, be it funny robots or over the top violence, it kept you hooked. season one didn't have one episode that wasn't at worst decent.the second season, i can say the worst one of season one is 100x better than the best episode of season two, if there was even a good episode.is like they hired gen z snow flakes to pick the episodes for season two ...skip season two at all costs.\",\"i love this kind of stuff. very reminiscent of the 80's classic heavy metal. more adult animation like this please!!\",\"everyone agrees that season 1 was an amazing exercise in animation. also everyone knows it wasn't always about storytelling but then it was certainly about art, and vica versa. some had done both, creating jaw dropping pearls like zima blue.however, like any piece of art comes into the world organically, this last season seems like an unrecognizable blurred copy of a copy where it feels like some self indulgent 80s producer walked in and said; \\\"don't mind the plot! add more gore! lots of gore!! that's what edgy kids like these days!!\\\"don't get me wrong, the animators did an outstanding job again because the visuals are great. but the plot really takes the last seat in the bus, except perhaps for the hilarious three robots and mason's rats. but those feel like kind of easy rehashes of the originals.so in short, watch it with low expectations, absolutely don't compare them with the great first season and be warned: they contain scenes of senseless, extreme violence, even for the hardened.\",\"i always like new idea ,and this series all about new ideas and perfectly surprised me by any episodes ,i f suggest you to watch it , you wont regret it\",\"it's very free, and creative. i like how each episode is different, and switches up the formula from other tv series. very intereeeeeee eeeeeesting.\",\"season 2: blahhhh\\nseason 3: very good, just wish the stories would keep going.i hope they make shows off of some of the ideas they had. way too good of material for these short segments, and extremely high quality cgi. sometimes i think it's real actors in the beginning. then i'm like dammm, that's a cartoon person.\",\"its not often that short film anthologies for adults are created that best reflect the short sci-fi stories that were found in the pulp pages of \\\"astounding science fiction\\\" and \\\"amazing stories\\\". normally you would need to read a novel or watch a full movie before the writer got to the crux of the matter. these episodes are typically less than 22 minutes and there is never a minute that is not justified in the storytelling. the stories in this series are varied in style and presentation as would be expected from the variety of creators and producers. typically they have a high quality concept and deliver animation, script and voices of the highest calibre. recommended for lovers of science fiction, fantasy and adventure.\",\"however this happened needs to be repeated over and over. if this was the only thing on netflix i would be happy. the whole collection was incredible and i can't wait for more.\",\"one of the only shows with true substance. love it. netflix needs more of these. a little bit of everything for everyone. mostly apocalyptic but very good, it gives a hope for the future. i give it a 10\\u002f10.\",\"i watched something this good and gripping for a whole. amazing animation and story line. i watched the whole season in one sitting and i cannot wait for season 2\",\"an amazing and diverse anthology with many memorable episodes. they are not connected in any way. everything is done exclusively for each episode, but this doesn't make it any worse. rather, on the contrary, this makes them even more colorful and exciting.another advantage of this series is that if you are a cinema nerd, then you will obviously get much more emotions than the average viewer, since there are enough references in each episode. every episode was made with tons of passion and talent.in some instances, the animation is simply divine! some episodes look so realistic that often it feels like you're watching a movie with real actors? everything is so clear and colorful. this and arcane gives rise to a completely logical idea that netflix in the near future may begin to develop a new direction in the animation industry. or has it already begun?love, death & robots is an amazing series. these are not only mini stories with beautiful visuals. it cannot be called simply entertaining. it touches on a lot of important topics and things. each episode provides certain information that is worth thinking about.\",\"i never leave reviews but this show.... i had to.\\nnetflix really did it this time. every episode in the series could actually get it's own show and be great some even phenomenal. personally my favorite is shape-shifters and sonnie's edge. the animation used is also on another level. this show is a top of the line series that hopefully gets more and more seasons. i hope everyone enjoys!\\ntrust me no matter what you are into, this show will not disappoint!\\nsit back, relax and enjoy this masterpiece!\",\"here is where sci fi changes for good. each story is its

its best avoided...\",\"before i begin i would suggest watching it backwards as the beginning is more densely populated with \\\"strong\\\" episodes.that said initially i wanted to give it 9 stars but the episodes are so heterogenous and appeal to the fans of hard sci-fi, cyberpunk, people superficially acquainted with japanese folklore, modern pop culture feats and many more. the graphics are 3d,2d 2,5d and whatever other d you can percept without using bulky accessories. the series deserve to be ranked as outstanding even though every episode spans no longer than 15 mins and varies in appeal to different audiences. if there is season 2 i hope it won't lose the twist the series possess though i can't see how can it surprise the viewer any more it already had.\",\"spectacular! one of the best tv series in years! hope they will make at least 12 seasons!\",\"if you haven't watched it yet... what are you waiting for?!?! this series should be seen by the entire world. something about

this.\",\"animation and plot were fantastic for most of the shorts. definitely not a family watch because some of these shorts had a surprising amount of nudity, rape, torture, rape torture, prostitution, rape torture prostitution and overall surprisingly morbid events. it was like dexter had a cameo in the script writing. the episodes that didn't include the aforementioned were amazing tho and would highly recommend those.\",\"we really don't need a tv show to tell us that there are some rather sick people in the world, let alone for that tv show to treat that sickness as

people have plumbed the depths of their depravity and tried to pass it off as entertainment. it is grotesque, appalling and quite vile.\",\"this show came out of nowhere with some outstanding animation all around and good writing that hooks the audience into it's 5-20 minute short stories, giving them just enough information to understand what's going on and become immersed in it's diverse world's without ever being didactic.l\\nd&r doesn't have a consistent type of animation. some are photo realistic, and others have a style more akin to what we'd see in morning cartoons. the creators always use the correct animation style for the type of story being told. some of these would had probably looked creepy or lost a degree of emotion had they looked either too realistic or too unrealistic.the shows biggest strength is it's outstanding variety. there's no overarcing theme or connection between any of the episodes, but they demonstrate a knack for quickly sparking interest. some are funny. some are serious. some are a mix of both. settings are unique and interesting and episodes often have a good twist at the end. highlights for me would be: beyond the aquila rift, the secret war, good hunting, and zima blue. there are still a few dumb or forgettable episodes such as: when the yogurt took over. watch this series and i'm sure you'll find some that you like

like three robots (2019) and alternate histories (2019) and captivate you with the beauty of pieces like beyond the aquila rift (2019) and fish night (2019). this is brilliantly unique and game-changing stuff from netflix, covering so many different genres like sci-fi, noir, cyberpunk, horror, comedy and all while making the content look so lifelike you'll swear you're watching live

with a second season. similar to the first season, each episode has different animation, for the most part, and only one episode wasn't animated. even though it's not thought-provoking and rich in

elements. they were adrenaline-inducing and intense in such a short amount of time. there was one episode that wasn't intense at all, and was more nonchalant and philosophical than the rest. this was

the old generation, not comfortable with modern technologies surroundings and science fiction movies or series in particular, but this tv show is absolutely outstanding because very dark, brilliant, surprising, where you have no stupid and predictable stories to please silly audiences, with happy endings galore destined to housewives. you find something new at every episode, something different, with a new approach of what the new technology provoke to our world in terms of problems and drifting. this is a social, political analysis of the modern world and warns us very brilliantly of what we are all exposed in the future. not for the cheesy and stupid audiences craving for good little stories, because it may be nasty, disturbing without any moral nor ethics at all. it is the new world. and all kinds of schemes too, adventure, romance, drama, thriller, action, crime.....i love it. you have too many of your right or left hand fingers to count the episodes where the stories are only a bit optimistic. all endings are at least bitter sweet and totally downbeat, gloomy at the most.\",\"\\\"how did humanity reach this point? will our future look like this?\\\" i watched many episodes of this show by asking myself these questions. each chapter is a different approach to think about the future of the world. and you will be notice that many of them look very scary.\",\"few episodes in i must say i'm impressed. the best thing was that i was completely into it. it kept me intrigued. good job netflix.\",\"i loved every one of these short films. beautiful animation and excellent storytelling and in parts absolutely insane. i watched the whole series in one sitting. cant wait for next series. probably one the the few shows on netflix i will sit through again it was that brilliant.\",\"definitely not for kids! love every story telling. great job writers, artist, graphic artist all of the artist and sound producers!!!\",\"if you like black mirror.. well.. you'll love this. love, death & robots is a series of short films with completely different backstories and design. it's hard to describe the series as anything else than a masterpiece. most of the episodes looks like a cinematic scene\\u002fclip from a video game - we're talking blizzard entertainment level folks. i freaking love it! i need more.\",\"from the prime minister's pajamas and dignitaries' uniforms, it reveals a thick black color, and the last section is like a state of war, which makes my back cool! e02 when he used his life to say the declaration of resistance, he finally surrendered

no idea what to expect going into this, but was not disappointed. the first episode is amazing and i truely wish the show was based on that. however, it's a bunch of unrelated shorts which are all good in their own sense and this is a great show you can just throw on at any time because the episodes are all unrelated. i feel this will be like the old nickelodeon series where they figure out which episode is most popular and make a series off of it. atleast i hope that's the case because episode one was unbelievable\",\"this series is very well written and extremely unique in its ideas. it explores the dark side of humanity and technology through each episode which features a stand alone story. if you were a fan of the twilight zone then this might float your boat, but it may be all too real for some people to handle!\",\"seriously , this is one of must watch, i dont have to say. if you watch at least 2 epis. no one can stop you from watching the whole series.since this is an anthology , you wont just stick to the same characters either , which is pretty cool and fresh . this show is the future literary.\",\"netflix has truly outdone themselves with this show. every episode offers captivating animations and great plot. you would think that an episode being 6 minuets would leave you wanting more but the few that are 6 minuets long are just as captivating as the rest. on top of that, the range of genres the show covers is impressive. you can watch a border-line horrifying episode and have the next be comedic. even though every episode is great, some i highly recommend are, \\\"sonnie's edge, three robots, beyond the aquila rift & zima blue\\\"\",\"true, if a wonderful story is what you're looking for, then the show might disappoint you. but the scenes in

work of art.\",\"some episodes are good, some are not, the main problem is bad writing, it can sometimes be cringeworthy but the good episodes save the series.\",\"normally i'm not into anim or animated stuff or over violent content, but i saw an episode was just 12 minutes or so, so i gave it a go when i was a bit bored. and what a pleasant surprise it was! because the episodes are so short, there is no filler at all and they just leave you wanting more after each story. from science fiction to comedy to thriller, it just keeps hopping genres, which is also what keeps it so fresh. i just which there were more episodes, absolutely brilliant!\",\"this series is a true eye opener for today 's modern times. it offers a very plausible simulation of a not-so-distant future and it's scary. really scary. makes you question your lifestyle and your choices. it tackles all addictive aspects of modern society, such as video games, social media, consumerism, etc. definetely worth watching, if you don't live in a box.\",\"very clever set of animations that will appeal to sci fi fans across the board.you may not like every episode, and some use pretty standard tropes that border

waldo moment as per me,the detailed and pure shocking episode would be black museum,the tech's and gadgets thing and the unsettling way human brain uses it and all it was literally awesome from

adult show in vol. 1 to a very mediocre (expect for one or two episodes,) mostly style over substance vol. 2. if you're considering to renew your netflix subscription just watch vol. 2, i'd suggest to wait for something more worth your money, and to watch vol. 2 as a background series then. but if you haven't seen vol. 1, watching vol. 2 first (or episodes from both volumes at random) might end up being a good experience overall.\",\"i think it's going to be a turning point for the anime movies production!the stories were unexpected, shocking sometimes and emotionally\\ninteractive despite how

rather hysterical and lacks the salient social\\u002ftechnological insight it used to offer.it's basically a giant mess now. sure, the acting is still good enough but there everything seems over the top. this pilot episode - national anthem - was a fully extreme episode but it was well-crafted and resonated with something deeply flawed at the core of modern life. i'm comparison to that episode, season 6 is predictable, hysterical and, to be honest, the season feels lazy.that's all i have to say. simply running up the character count now. meow meow meow woof laser hands. pew pew.\",\"this is honestly some of the best content on netflix. with each episode being a different short story, each one grips you more than most feature length tv shows streaming on netflix at the moment. great writing and stunning animation. season 2 falls short of how good season 1 was, but still great nonetheless.\",\"animation is next level, the stories are weird and beautiful each short movie is better then the other and who ever created this show he has a twisted imagination this show is a solid 9 for me.\",\"for those of us who grew up reading \\\"heavy metal\\\" magazine and may have seen the movie, this series definitely scratches that itch. this is more than twilight zone sci-fi. it's a guilt pleasure to take the ride. i hope more episodes are produced. i also hope that the younger generation can tap into what might be called \\\"source material\\\" because this show is everything \\\"heavy metal\\\" was. i'm wondering if or how much the creators may have been inspired by the art and stories of that bold publication. kudos for being different, for being edgy, for the unbounded use of imagination. i'm stopping this review now as i have a few episodes remaining. check out sammy hagar's signature tune on the \\\"heavy metal\\\" soundtrack!\",\"the biggest let down is how over hyped this is, it set my expectations high. this is just eat carpet from the 90's and 00's re runs we've all seen before, except for our generation. but unlike eat carpet it's skewed because netflix writes for netflix first, for entertainment last. they have to check off all the netflix approved talking points and try and shoehorn entertainment somewhere in the end of it all which leads to failure almost always.\",\"an exceptionally well crafted series with gorgeous animation and a uniquely immersive soundtrack, whats remarkable about these shorts is how quickly you can become so deeply and emotionally invested in the stories they are telling. every character feels alive and real, human or otherwise, and each brilliantly executed scenario subverts the expectations set by its predecessor; i would watch entire ten hour seasons set in any one of them, though perhaps what most makes them shine is in fact how quickly they're over, and how lasting of an impression they leave all the same.\",\"i've only just seen the first episode (national anthem) and i am absolutely impressed!!! i've seen some negative reviews citing how the show is disturbing but that is quite literally the entire point of why i liked it. it would be like criticizing a roller coaster because it felt dangerous. well, in my case, that would be a damn good reason why i'd love a particular roller coaster.i guess i have the ability to separate fictional strife (this show, roller coasters, scary movies) from real strife (which i don't like at all). aside from the story itself, i was impressed with the \\\"realism\\\" in portraying something that is in a slightly bizarro world version of ours. i guess i can imagine how hollywood would screw this up with \\\"over-the-topness\\\". the british production values are at their best here.\",\"if you don't have time to watch this anthology then make some...be truly amazed at the technology, story telling, types of animation , the ability to create something truly amazing. each time one short passed by the next was equally remarkable, it's a true thrill ride giving the viewer a white knuckle ride on something never experienced within watchable content of animation. netflix i tip my hat to you. wow\",\"for what it is, it's amazing. i never expected them to fit a riveting storyline in 10 minute episodes. what each episode does is it feel like you're dropped in to witness a portion of an ongoing saga that you will force you to imagine the beginning and the end on your own. but make no mistake, the 10 minutes you're in it is simply wild. i really appreciate the brutality and realism they depict and eagerly await the next season. definitely not for kids.\",\"it's like bringing on dust and cgi shorts on youtube, but much more polished in terms of the animation and the story snippets. for the movie about the refrigerator, i can't even distinguish the characters from live action. the story snippets are exactly that -- a situation, and as much about the character that can be portrayed in that time. many of the shorts don't have a complete story per se, but that was not its intent. there is no chacracter building, but then again, that is not the purpose of these shorts. they are skits, and as such, very well done.\",\"look at the cover and all you see is an animation and something that contains a nsfw tag. look beneath and you see a combination of unique animations, compelling stories and so much more! every episode pulls you into its story and it's unique animation leaves you in awe. it's an absolute beauty and a must watch. but beware it is not for the faint of heart.\",\"the third season didn't follow the feel of the previous seasons. i would rate the first two seasons a 9 and the last a 7 being generous. the last season was like preaching homosexuality, i'm not hating on anyone but no thanks. it turned a cutting edge science fiction series into something completely different. i was really bummed out.\",\"...alfred hitchcock, the x-files, or fringe. i cannot add too much to all the other stellar reviews. this series popped up on netflix and, after the first wild & crazy episode, i binged. writing: incredible! the scripts are in the realm of j.j. abrams quality with serious development evident and fine tuning obvious; crafted. charlie brooker is genius. directing: the type of emotion and passion pulled from every single actor is just incredible; camera work seamless. consider that each of the original six episodes were directed uniquely, the result across the series is a real achievement. acting: take episode one's pm: rory kinnear playing the part of michael callow. he hit the mark so fantastically, and on top of that the supporting cast in that same episode all conveyed such incredible feeling. empathy was basically thrown at you through their eyes - extras included. there were so many great performances, but one in particular by lenora crichlow as victoria skillane in episode six, deserves mention. as the primary character with complete focus throughout, her efforts were emmy worthy. summary: so surprisingly good i was truly blown away. a series like this does not come about often. i hope you enjoy it as much as so many others have.\",\"i want season 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\ni want season 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\ni want season 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\",\"keeping things to the point:\\nyes season 1 had more episodes, with excellence amongst them, but season 2 still retains the charm, wonder and fantastic craft of these story writers and those that animate their ideas.anyone disappointed with s2, (many have voiced that here on imdb) that's a pity. the only thing that disappoints me with s2 is the fewer episodes, as i can't help but get through the episodes with some pace!not wanting to sound condescending to other more negative reviewers (they can express as they please) but i take the view that i would like to see more of this...more love death & robots. that is more likely to happen if we will it.to potential viewers, go ahead and watch, and do not be dissuaded by the negative reviews...particularly that of s2. it's all great if you keep and open mind and go with the flow.\",\"a somewhat cheesy and derivative animation anthology series which lacks a common thread.each \\\"episode\\\" is standalone, and about 20 minutes long, so you can watch the whole thing in a single sitting.a big player of video games, and consumer of science fiction myself, on paper this seems right up my alley, but i found the stories to be a a little on the nose and lacking any gravitas or depth.there have been comparisons to the animatrix, but this falls well short, as the animatrix is a continuation of the philosophical questions and discussions that arise from the well thought out preceding ip the matrix (1999).not essential viewing, but a good time nevertheless.\",\"not often i care to log in to imdb to actually write a review, but this title deserves one.it can be summed up in one sentence: this is something you have to see if you're into sci-fi. (probably if you're not too.)\",\"simply amazing. most episodes have really interesting ideas that pick up on the technology currently used and just take it up a notch as to its use in the future. the plot twists at the end of some episodes made my spine tingle, while some gave a really uncomfortable feelingif it wasn't for the really bad season 5 and a mediocre season 4, it would have been a 10\",\"very shock and violence driven. feels very pretentious at times and very little self awareness in that regard.some episodes are definitely better than others. i did not have a great time, many ideas do not feel like they are entirely thought through. writing feels very messy at times. for me personally it felt like a waste of time. but also understand it is not for me.\",\"sure the art is excellent, but people can create art without having to have so much violence, gore and sex with one or more wrapped into each episode. a couple of them were really great, but most are just violent, bloody messes, and even the good ones had it in them. i'm not expecting mary poppins, but was expecting a bit more intellectually and challenging subjects that had more than violence for the backbone of the show.\",\"i like the risks that are taken in this series. episodes are almost always, politically correct, but there are a couple that include some non-political concepts that make people uncomfortable when thinking about them . . . and that is what i love most about this series . . . that, and some groundbreaking cg animation.i do wish the show didn't shy away from nudity so much, since it's almost entirely animated. unfortunately, there probably are extra costs incurred from government restrictions and threats, and hollywood guilds that charge for every nipple shown.the concepts are still interesting to watch, including the many comedic ones, which did make me laugh a lot. i still prefer the non-comedic episodes.\",\"this is a refreshing unique take on human obsessions in the 21st century and how it damages us to a degree . i like the different aspects of how we are shown and in a way warned about our current obsession with technology so take heed of warning to your own use of out so called necessities of today's digital world .\",\"amazing and very entertaining. i hope it gets season 2. favourite episodes: beyond the aquila rift, sucker of souls, good hunting, shape shifters.\",\"other than the first episode the remaining are all very similar in style of animation, and without much humor, fright, charisma, or heart. did not really vibe with any of the characters or the stories, again other than the first episode. unlike the fantastic season 1, all of which i re-watched more than once, season 2 will not get as much as a second glance.\",\"season one was incredible. a little something for anyone. great variety and vision in small samples. like short stories. it was 18 episodes!season two. even shorter episodes. only a few of

3 hits the spot again!glad netflix picked it up again as they are sitting on a gold mine. it is a very good production too bad season 2 now sits in the middle as the dark sheep.\",\"i went into watching this with some scepticism because animation that veers towards the more end of the spectrum can all too often be all style and little substance.this has both.it is an utterly absorbing and at times enthralling collection of varied short animated stories that go from comedy, love, sci-fi, fantasy and horror (sometimes combining more than one genre), each with an interesting message to take, that is not always obvious at the start.some of the animation is superb and the creative minds often sublime.not always for the fainthearted and definitely adults only.at times your emotions will be like a rollercoaster and even your morals and ethic uncomfortably ruffled but with a delicious feeling that is almost intoxicating.it's like the best of foods. one nibble and you suddenly can't resist wanting more.there is one thing missing from the creators and writers, a full, feature length movie, which would be a mind bending blockbuster if they ever decide to put their minds to what they have the undoubted ability to achieve.\",\"short beautiful episodes. there are no unnecessary talk, moody scenes, family trees. this show is completely opposite of traditional soap operas. title, bang-bang, credits! the only wishes are less blood and more alive actors. i was very happy to see ones in the ice age episode\",\"this collection of 18 animated short movies is marvelous! each one of them has a smart story and an exciting staging. we need more stuff of that kind. thank you netflix for this masterpiece!\",\"the 1st episode just blowed my brain and i was yelling what😮!! the!!!?? by the end of the episode.\\nthe quality of animation was brilliant and amazing i wanted to watch more and more but.. in the episodes were very small. even their stories were owsome 😍 and finished the total series in one go.\",\"i had previously given a 10 to this show when i had watched the first season. i was amazed by the animation, the story, the direction... and so much more. had to try really hard to find a flaw.on the contrary, season 2 did not live up to the expectations at all. utterly disappointed with the rush in ending a story, loose plots and shawdy work that looks like it has been done in haste. the only few episodes worth watching would be as follows:1. pop squad\\n2. life hutch\\n3. the drowning of the gianti came to imdb to give a rating of 6 or something for the second season, but i realised that would over shadow the amazing work that they had created in the first. so just taking away 1 point.season one set expectations really high!!!!!!\",\"each episode is unique and exciting. many stories have charecters that remain in our mind for a while.excellent addition to sci fi genre.\",\"this is one of the most amazing series i seen recently.it clearly shows the dark side of the technology - sometimes it looks similar to 1984 and the brave new world. it has a dark (noire) style and it is not an optimistic view of our near future, but it really catch the moment. this is not a story what you can watch easily, you need to prepare your mind to be opened to the future technologies and the dark side of the humanity. you experience and learn how man can give u sovereignty and independence. it is a vision of total control and mass surveillance never seen before. there is an episode for a kind of digitized heaven and eternal life, but the story about humans , their minds and how they can deal the options they have. so fasten your seat belt and start your journey...\",\"this takes me back when i was a kid when i would get heavy metal magazines, the art work and the stories would transport me to that world. then heavy metal the movie came out and just blew my mind. i love the short story format and the graphics are just amazing.two thumbs up 👍👍.i hope it continues.\",\"season one was brilliant, a game changer. season two had its amazing moments but also its flaws. season three, however, manages to have you sit in front of the screen again - awestruck and amazed by the storytelling, emotions, and editing\\u002fsound.\",\"the animation from episode to episode uses different styles but is all absolutely wonderful. the stories, some bizarre, some dark, some downright hilarious are all gripping from start to finish. i have only one problem with this show and its by no way a criticism its more due to my own greed, so many of these short stories should be feature length films!!\",\"watched every episode in one sitting. even the stories that weren't my cup of tea were brilliant and held my interest. the short running time does nothing to hinder the stories. one of the best things netflix has ever had on offer.\",\"\\u003c3. x.[._.]\\nan incredible anthology that delivered another collection of masterfully created works with the second volume.\",\"love, death a robots is a true piece of art that belongs to the streaming service - netflix. the first and most remarkable feature of all is the animation. it is definitely the key in the success of the show. the idea of the series is rather simple: you get a bunch of short movies that are not related to one another and that focus on different themes and genres, (a bit like \\\"black mirror\\\"). the difference between this show and \\\"black mirror\\\" is that \\\"black mirror\\\" does have a motive and meaning in all of it's different episode.love, death a robots is more complicated, at one point you did wish there would be some sort of narrative or idea that connects between all the different stories and episodes. overall i believe the fact that this series is so wide with stories, characters and different genres is what makes the series so special. i could have noticed that most of the episodes focused on technology, science fiction and supernatural. with every short story having a slight of humor. every episode has a deep meaning such as \\\"zima blue\\\" and \\\"fish night\\\". some episodes are mind blowing and have a major twist in the plot like \\\"beyond the aquila rift\\\" and \\\"the witness\\\". some episodes are mainly for action and humor likewise \\\"suits\\\", \\\"sonnie's edge\\\", \\\"the secret war\\\", \\\"blind spot\\\", \\\"when the yogurt took over\\\" and \\\"alternate histories\\\".my favorite episode was \\\"three robots\\\", not only the minor references that were made but also the whole vibe of the episode was really uplifting. i also would have wished the episodes were a bit longer and would have give more intel over the characters, there were moments where i wanted to explore the story even better and find out what happened to each character in each short movie.season two was slightly disappointing, maybe not as much as fans would assume, i believe it had a lot of potential but due to the short amount of episodes it couldn't be compared to season 1. if it had the same amount of episodes such as in season 1 (18), i believe there would have been much to talk about. i am highly anticipating for the third season (coming 2022) and can't wait to explore new stories and worlds in this masterpiece series.\",\"every episode of this show either presents a unique concept and\\u002for artistic style. it will always surprise you with a twist in the events and leave you wanting more. i really want another season.\",\"this is a review of season 2 (i don't remember s1). some of these stories are really well done but they feel very short. this is like watching 5 min episodes of the twilight zone or similar show.there was more than one story where when it finished i was like wtf? what was that? what was the point? it was like watching a bunch of trailers one after the other, interesting, fast and leaving you wanting so you want to tune in and watch what the trailer introduced you to. but there is no more.i remember really liking season 1, but after this one i am not sure i would recommend it, although i did find it entertaining for what it was.\",\"such a great show, it's so sick but so interesting. i love most of the stories! metalhead in s4 was awful. worth a watch, check it out people! it's on netflix and it's really really good!!!!\",\"yet again, the zeitgeist of this generation takes another big nose dive; but it isn't so apparent to most i'd imagine because the aesthetic is so pleasing to the senses. indeed, volume ii definitely continues raising the bar in terms of artistic expression. but it falls well below the mark when it comes to character and plot development. before i saw it, i tried to moderate my expectations realizing the situation was a little like having intercourse for the first time and even that did not prepare me for the drop in quality. indeed, volume i had a much larger budget obviously and was probably only ever intended to be a one-off. its catalog included: fantastic elements of horror; the occult; post humanity; same-sex relationships; uplifted animals; sentient robots; transhumanism; cyborgs; aspects of virtual reality; telepathic aliens; and even couple of mechs.the question shouldn't be: was the second iteration of love, death, + robots as good as the first; but rather, does it carry the torch forward? and the answer is a resounding, yes. in this collection, the stories were shorter, but tended to be centrally focused around the core topics of death and robots. my absolute favorite three were: pop squad, ice, and snow in the desert.\",\"one of the best series which can keep you entangled with standalone episodes. been on my watch list for years. but once i started it i never knew how it all ended just in a day. charlie brooker's knowledge on human mentality is epic. all the things that are shown in series are actually plausible. people are losing their empathy as it is not of any financial value.each and every episode of this has made me think for hours.my personal favorites from the first two seasons are1.the national anthem. 2.the entire history of you.3.the white christmas.4.the waldo moment.5.15 million merits.6.be right back.\",\"it has been quite some years i've sat to watch an anthology, but this, the animation, the stories, the emotion. quite frankly,i would call this one of the pinnacles of cinema and a masterpiece if i ever saw one.ps: lots of sex, nudity and gore. just brilliant!!!!\",\"the writing, the characters, music... and animation styles made my jaw drop. didn't expect this kind of quality content from netflix. they really outdone themselves. simply a masterpiece.\",\"...i loved this series for the variety of styles and themes. my 2 fave eps,(..which i have revisited many times..),were 'sonnies edge' and 'snow in the desert',i felt that both these little vignettes crammed more excitement and pulse-pounding, visceral action into 18 minutes or so than almost any recent film i can think of. there were loads of off-beat humour and surreal stories sometimes quite horrific and nearly always thought provoking which i loved, add superb voice work,music and sound effects and really, you've got a winner in your hands. like many others, i certainly hope they do some more....personally, i would love to see more of 'sonnie' and mr 'snow' but i suspect we will not...shame, that.....\",\"this series is sublime, it provides everything you could ever want and imagine in sci-fi! i've never been so moved... for me each episode was like walking through an art gallery and viewing the greatest works of art.\\nbravo?\",\"my review will be short and sweet...season 1 was incredible...season 2 was almost absolute trash.\",\"there is season 2 coming and i hope there is more episodes like sonnie's edge , the witness or lucky 13\",\"i watch the first episode and thought this was brilliant, these funny, witty robots walking around a destroyed earth trying to understand human life and their existence. the next two were pretty good as well, i liked the ice age one. however, the episodes that followed after were totally not to my liking and then i gave up. they became about wars, fighting, blood, guts, slimy monsters, no thanks! but if you like those sorts of things then you'll probably would enjoy this.\",\"some very unique and interesting stories told in this series which may not be possible in movies, s2 is average but s1 was very good.\",\"this series is a pure gold. it is so fascinating and very well made, that i admire those who write the stories. such a creative team! not all the episodes are perfect, (while, most of them are..) but this concept is a perfection. sci-fi series that is not about promoting sci-fi, but how we humans could get affected by new technologies. it makes you think, and it makes you think deep.\",\"in most movies\\u002ftv series, they have 1-2 great ideas but try to make 8-12 episodes with 4-5 seasons or make a 2 hour boring movie with 20 min great story. however, i was really happily surprised.the season 1 has 18 episodes with mostly sci-fi and sometimes drama or somewhat dystopic themes and each episode is 5-10 min short but really well to the point. i was better touched in most episodes of season 1 than what other sci-fi or drama artworks try to embrace and bore in 2 hours.additionally, in most artworks, we see 1-2 great episodes (1-2 great parts in those 1-2 episodes). however, all the episodes have been unique and great.since episodes are really short, we cannot talk much about the characters but i could still feel for the characters because the emotions were well portrayed and mostly sad but there are happy endings, too . i was especally amazed by episode 7, 8, 14. i anticipated most of the endings but this also shows how well the episodes has been prepared.also, the episodes are not with the same visual techniques each different technique is also well suited for the contents of the episode.finally, i want to thank everyone who made me watch this great show.ps: most episodes also somewhat reminded me of black mirror by putting a mirror to us\\u002fhumans.\",\"unreal! a lot for think about after each episode.\\nbest series ever.\",\"there are many ups and downs in this show. however, i found most episodes enjoyable and easier to watch through. i loved the mesmerizing topics about space, science, and nature that this show presented. overall, volume 1 was the best by a mile. volume 1 had the best characters, storylines, and everything else. i would give volume 1 a 9\\u002f10 or a 10\\u002f10. however, i can't say the same about volume 2. i did like the concepts, just not as much as i liked volume 1's concepts. the show sometimes felt dry, and it was the most tame out of all of them. there would only be a couple episodes i would recommend. volume 2 gets a 6\\u002f10 or a 7\\u002f10. on the other hand, they made a comeback with volume 3. volume 3 was a breath of fresh air from volume 2, and i loved the concepts. it was tame, but not as tame as volume 2 and not as exposed as volume 1. the episodes were more intriguing to watch, and volume 3 gets a 8\\u002f10. if this show is getting a new volume, i hope they keep up the comeback because this show could go the mile.\",\"i love it. i love it. i love it.i'm just sad there's not more. that's literally all i came here to say.\",\"not all the episodes are great, but most of them, for sure... i think it is a try-out for netflix, the best ones survive. mayby a netflix movie in the future!\",\"the volume 3 will entertain you just like the volume 2. can't say it got better but still some unique stories with great animation makes it a worth watch.\",\"absolutely perfect. nothing else to say. i wish every animated series or film today is created with this level of detail and style.even kids shows creators could learn a thing or two from these people.i was just looking trough some negative reviews earlier and goddamn some people should just be banned from this site lol.\",\"season 1 - 10\\u002f10 outstanding, dark, funny, full of ingenious twist and turns.season 2 - lazy and generic.was so excited to see a second season but it was a complete let down barring maybe two episodes.hoping for a season 3 with the more input from season 1.\",\"season 1 was spectacular but i'm very disappointed with s2!! wth happened?! season 1 was everything i wanted in an speculative anthology sci-fi series, but s2 was half-assed thrown together stories that weren't even interesting, and at times down right awful. i just don't get it?!\",\"sorry, but season two is pants compared to the first season.the stories are not as good, the endings fall flat, the constant smoking is just weird.the animation? it ranges from being incredible to being just a bit 'meh'.i watched it waiting for the two or three killer episodes that were going to save the season. they never came, the season ended and that was that.\",\"loved every min almost if these episodes , me and my sons watched it togther the animation was great and so was the acting , told my son was just like the old heavy metal magazines, dug em out to show him, cant wait for season 2\",\"we all are painfully aware the quality has decreased in season 2. less episodes, less meat to the stories. i'm comforted that i wasnt the only one disappointed. but i truly think if they just rewatch their own season 1 and understand what made it work. that they will somehow bring it back for 3. here's hoping.\",\"netflix never fails to surprise you... whenever i think what new could now be made.. netflix is like boom.. this is my 60th netflix series and netflix has never failed to impress me seriously...\",\"so as weird as it may sound i only just got into watching bm, i had heard of it but just never gotten around to it i guess, but with everything going on i have been watching them but not binge watching cuz they are very heavy and dark and leave you leaving disturbed. however despite that i'm sure i don't have to tell anyone just how brilliant it is now having seen most of the episodes. as i said this show us on par with the godfather of anthology shows tz and i think if rod serling was alive today this is these are the kinds of stories he would write i think. charlie brooker is a genius writer who really has a grasp on where we are and where we are heading with technology and all the good and really bad that can come with it. in hated in the nation that one really showed the bad of pack mentality and the vicious jerks people can be in social media, i only rarely use fb, and the that one really hit home for me. so if you are looking for something to watch with absolutely brilliant writing, acting, cinematography and plot twists you will never see coming do yourself a favor and watch black mirror.\",\"there is no doubt that first season is almost perfect.the concept of the second season is very good. but it is too short and lacks storytelling. there are some hints of details that can make people guess the ending. (except for the christmas present episode)some plots happen too deliberately( pop squad ). if it is a long story, there are many details before that, which will look more natural.i have to admit that short novels are actually too short. sometimes it is not the fault of the production team.i have to say, the one who made the trailer video is the \\\"best\\\", because season 2 with all the short stories and misleading me to keep the expected as the same as the season 1\\nanyway, the quality of the effect is top1. please don't miss this series.the independent animation market is too small, but it is still very exciting.please, pls vote for it and let's keep it longer!\",\"every episode was mind blowing, and i did not expect that.. this show is just superb! whoever wrote the stories is simply a prodigy, also the animation, the styles, the designs were all excellent, to be honest i don't have a single bad thing to say about this anthology, it was all beyond brilliant and genius! definitely a must see!!\",\"each episode of love, death & robots tells a different story using different drawing techniques. some parts are anime, some parts are animation, and even the technique used in some parts was so good that i couldn't distinguish between animation or real for a while. each episode has a philosophical topic that we can think about or a message they want to give us. the fact that the subjects in the episodes are different gives the producers of the series unlimited subject rights, and the producers have used this right extremely well. the fact that the episodes are too short is also a plus for the series. the series never bores you. because when you start the episode, it ends immediately and makes you ask yourself the question 'what did i watch?'. it makes you think about the episode. if you want to watch a short, perfect and different animation series prepared with different techniques, love, death & robots is for you.\",\"just... purely amazing! there is one episode (beyond the aquila rift) where i literally thought it was shot in real-life. the cgi was incredibly life-like. beautifully animated throughout the whole series, and the stories are mind-blowing. there is always a twist, sometimes you kinda sorta know it but others completely came out of nowhere.\\nplease please please let us see a second season.\",\"its odd to see such great storytelling in season 1 and a complete 180 in season 2. the lack of episodes in season 2 was a let down. would i watch s3? yea sure in hopes they recapture what they did in s1.\",\"love, death & robots is deep, artistic, well written and influential 18 short stories. the series can be perceived as 18 pilots for new series. of course, few episodes fall flat, but there is something for every taste. the gathering of that number of incredibly talented animators and writers and showcasing them in such an intense production is a bold, daring, and game changing move by netflix.\",\"all the different genres, with amazing futuristic and fantastical story lines. short episodes with quality ranging from old cartoons to high-end cgi makes it the perfect series for anyone. it doesn't bore you. every episode is a surprise. i really recommend this show.\",\"i love short films and i often go, well, i used to go to short film festivals.\\nthis series doesn't disappoint, it's all the same, ranginf from excellent and original, to mostly poor and already seen thousands of times.\\nmy only concern is that it has nothing to do on netflix, we know how it works, and it is all about money. i don't know how they chose the studios and if they had total creative freedom or not. also, it would have liked a bit more \\\"love\\\" films (except if showing boobs means \\\"love\\\" to them).\\ni wouldn't call it a series either as there's basically nothing linking those short films together. i'd rather call it a collection.\\nanyways, all in all, these short films are great but i would have liked it better if it wasn't netflix.\",\"this anthology gives the best of cgi\\u002fgraphics with some looking so real i had to google whether it was actual graphics or not (i'm talking the episode with michael b jordan)...either way, the original stories and plotlines (that range so much) are absolutely fascinating. some are so captivating they act as a trailer to a movie you really wanna see! i've loved both series and only hope they continue to make more.\",\"after my cousin and cousin-in-law showed genuine freaked-outness and enthusiasm about these series i decided to watch it.the series is indeed quite original. and the fact that all the episodes deal with some negative side-effect from technology makes it relevant. but even though i definitely believe the technological possibilities proposed in the episodes, i certainly can't believe the human aspect. the behavior of the characters is farfetched, unbelievable. exactly in that sense: i don't believe them.i guess this would categorise the series as 'horror', scary things happen and the characters overreact and do silly things, things that people wouldn't do in reality. and there's the snag for me: the series seems to want to use something from reality, technology, to scare us, yet fails to do so because of the characters' responses. there also is a strange focus on certain themes that seem to be the biggest horror to the creators of the show, and they are usually very sexual. mostly men having to deal with the woman they love not having sex with them.i'd like to see this show grow. i'd like it to become more 'thriller' instead of 'horror'. i want to actually believe these things could happen. well... only for an hour or so ;) \\ni'd like to see this show grow and create storylines that involve more variant fears, and i can see they seem to be doing this. hear, hear!so yes, please, go on. i cant' wait for the creators to really scare me silly... in the future.\",\"where is it heading, i think the creators have run short of ideas or how to implement them. it used to rely n tech concepts, questioning morality, shocking incidents all close to reality. the latest season is just another netflix usual like the \\\"usual\\\" serial killer, random demons etc etc \\\"future\\\" or \\\"past\\\" part all take a back seat to some mediocre story telling. last 5 years i have been going out of my way to recommend this series to people, but now i hope they do not start from this season!for me the biggest cons :\\n1. slow and boring story telling\\n2. hysterical sometimes, but not in a good way.3. many \\\"oh no, why\\\" moments where things do not make sense, and no not like the pig episode in an earlier season, disturbing but fell right in place.4. episodes seem like a collection of other netflix b-grade shows.\",\"i love this concept, although i like animation in general. all of the episodes are vastly different in terms of presentation, but theming as well. the only resemblance is in the key words of the title.\\nmost episodes are good, some are passable, while others are jewels of animation. beware that none of the episodes are suitable for children, so don't be fooled by the graphical style. most episodes feature adult theming with faul language, violence, horror, boobies and some even have sex scenes.here are my impressions:\\n1.sonnie's edge - brutal, edgy and thrilling with the bestfight of the series. one of the best of the series.2. three robots -funny with likable characters.3. the witness - paranoial. alternative and artistic.deserves a shot.4. suits - enjoyabl and actionful, but simple.5. sucker of souls- this one was a let down for me. skippable.6. when the yoghurt take over - silly and light. for the fan.7. beyond the aquila rift - amazing horror sc-fi with gorgeous sex scene and crazy reveal. probably the beste episode in the series.8. good hunting - beautiful story progression and finds a perfect balance between a dark and light tone. one of the best of the series.9. the dump - meh10. shape-shifters - not very speciall in terms of story but cool and action-packed.\\n11. helping hand - short and very tenseful. captivating.12.fish night - nice ambiance but disappointing story and the worst dialogue. skip to prevent disappointment.13.lucky 13 - easily on par with helping hand and shape-shifters. features a lot of sci-fi action and a believable and likable main character.14. zima blue - stylistic with a great message to tell. don't be deceived by the first two minutes.15. blind spot - ok, i guess, but nothing special or anything else to give than fighting and riacing robots.16. ice age- pretty neat and enjoyable in the moment.17. alternate histories -not my cup of tea, but enjoyable for a lucky few.18.the secret war - great action and shooting. excellent in what it wants to do.\",\"this compelling series make you think. it's definitely not one of those bubblegum flavored shows that one just spits out and forget about the

have ever watched in my life.\",\"love this! really good entertainment!\\nalthough, it might keep you awake at night... watching just one more episode. just one more...\",\"it seems superlatives are needed to describe this anthology series, judging by the 10\\u002f10 reviews i'm seeing. some call it a masterpiece, pure orgasm, a work of art, thought provoking, genius. i'll just call it \\\"not that great\\\".i did enjoy watching all of the episodes and i hope to see more of this series. with a runtime of around 10 minutes on average per episode, it's hard to get to the point where you'll actually start to really dislike it, because by then the episode is already over. quite clever. the twists at the end are usually a letdown.a quick rundown of everything:1. sonnie's edge - 7,5\\u002f10. a decent story with at least a beginning, middle and ending. good animation, somewhat clunky at times. a bit heavy on the misandry\\u002ffeminism, which means a -1 from me.2. three robots - 5\\u002f10. not much here besides some preaching. too political and otherwise nothing special at all. has been done better before.3. the witness - 7\\u002f10. great visuals. as a story, this wasn't too bad, but it's all about the ending. and once you know the ending, you realize the journey to the ending was entirely pointless. they tried to cover that up with a lot of nudity.4. suits - 5\\u002f10. not bad, but quite boring and nothing special. the little twist at the end is not nearly good enough enough to save it.5. sucker of souls - 5\\u002f10. not much of a story here. it's like starting a mediocre movie half way towards the end, where you fall asleep again at some point and wake up just before the ending, which again isn't good enough to save it.6. when the yogurt took over - 5\\u002f10. why are we humans so self-destructive? this message again, in under 5 minutes, through a crazy metaphor.7. beyond the aquila rift - 9\\u002f10. one of the better episodes, even when it's totally predictable. great visuals, proper story.8. good hunting - 8\\u002f10. i actually liked this, although part of the message it wants to send across is a bit questionable.9. the dump - 6\\u002f10. visually entertaining and at 5 minutes in length there's not much more to it.10. shape-shifters - 8\\u002f10. good and entertaining episode. the ending could have been better.11. helping hand - 8,5\\u002f10. very good episode. visually pleasing. great little story to experience in under 10 minutes.12. fish night - 3\\u002f10. i don't even.13. lucky 13 - 8,5\\u002f10. proper story, simple but with a lot of action. visually very pleasing.14. zima blue - 6\\u002f10. it tries to tell you something that you may find very interesting to think about. or it's just pretentious. in terms of enjoyment, i didnt get much out of it.15. blind spot - 4\\u002f10. decent enough to watch, but when the ending hits you after about 7 minutes, you realize you just wasted 7 minutes.16. ice age - 5\\u002f10. an interesting concept, but this has been done before, and it has been done before way, way better. the acting is totally cringeworthy, -1 for that.17. alternate histories - 4\\u002f10. not very funny at all. wasted opportunity, could have been a lot better.18. the secret war - 8\\u002f10. this episode felt more like watching cutscenes of a computer game. still decent overall, though, and worth watching.all in all, that comes down to a 6,5\\u002f10. some good, some bad, nothing truly great.\",\"season 1 : 8.5\\u002f10 - except a couple of episodes , rest were watchable and animation was good.season 2 : 7.5\\u002f10 - some stories fell flat but the animation was superb as compared to the previous season.season 3 : 8\\u002f10 - here the animation and stories are better than s02 but the 3-4 stories had average content.will update the review after successive seasons.\",\"season 1 had mostly good episodes. lot of interesting stories, originality, and different animation styles. season 2 was just garbage. almost every episode was just a flashy cgi tech demo of how realistic looking they could make their characters. the stories were stale and cliche. the characters are forgettable and the dialogue is just cringe. having just watched castlevania season 4 probably set the quality bar way to high. just watch that instead!\",\"just started watching this in 2015 and i'm completely blown away, every single episode manages to really disturb me and touch me on an emotional level. the series, in which we follow a new set of characters in a new story each episode we see the flaws of our society, how technology, art, politics and so on can utterly obliterate our sense of reality. the different themes of each episode is very welcoming and the stories fit perfectly in the 40min time frame. i can without doubt say that this is the most heartfelt and sad series i have ever watched and after days i'm still thinking about each and every episode!must see 10\\u002f10\",\"no words can express this series.... i suggest everyone human in the world should watch this series.. the director clearly expressing his thoughts what happens when we all connected to machine so much .. it will damage our life's and our ability... this become my favourite series in my life .. selute to all worker to making this series... great selute to director and story writer 🙏🙏\",\"a short story \\u002f film anthology with some of the best technical standards & artistic variety of story telling and animation i've ever seen.great from start to finish, each episode with a twist \\u002f ending worth waiting for. only warning is that it's for adults only with very strong language, explicit sexual imagery \\u002f themes and bloody violence throughout. but the swearing\\u002fnudity\\u002fgore tends to add authenticity, and a sense of genuine peril, to the characters and their unique situations, rather than be gratuitous. with a diversity of stories & styles including; violent crime (sonnies edge \\u002f the witness \\u002f blindspot), war (lucky 13 \\u002f the secret war \\u002f shape shifters), comedy (when the yogurt took over \\u002f alternate histories \\u002f three robots) and straight up classic science fiction (ice age \\u002f helping hand \\u002f beyond the aquila rift \\u002f fish night) \\\"love, death & robots\\\" leaves viewers wanting for nothing. if you don't like the current story\\u002fstyle, just wait 10 mins and the next one might be the best tv you have watched in ages. original, dark, funny, thought provoking & action packed, as well as visually dissolving the barriers between live-action, animation and v-fx \\u002f cgi, this has got to be a cult classic already. worth it for \\\"zima blue\\\" (animation), \\\"the secret war\\\" (cgi), \\\"the witness\\\" (wtf!) and \\\"three robots\\\" (dialogue), but i think my real favorite is 'the yogurt'. watch it, it's worth it.\",\"first season was so powerful. zima blue and when the yogurt took over are memorable works but season two not worth to watch so\\ndisappointing.\",\"animation, direction, story and every minute of each episode is brilliant.\",\"but very good quality. i watched without getting bored. season 1 was better but still nice.\",\"i will be very careful not to spoil this episode because it's quite brilliant and you deserve to undergo the same levels of surprise and appreciation that i did in your viewing experience.the setup, in the show universe, is basically that the online end-user \\\"terms of use\\\" agreements common to the market contain toxic clauses that allow the corporate providers to commandeer the content of their user's lives in unexpectedly drastic, sweeping and unforeseen ways.you and i, in this real and present viewer universe, all sign (and rarely read) such eulas whenever we access our various online apps and services and their updates. this is just our present reality, so it's not much of a stretch to empathize with the female protagonist of the episode, as she has her privacy shattered and her life, let's say, roundly and creatively exploited for the enjoyment of the masses and the profit of the provider and it's ceo.the tragedy and comedy that ensue are so clever and engaging that as the show progressed (let's just say, past the halfway point) i was absolutely delighted with what i'd watched thus far and and absolutely convinced i knew how it would deliciously end. but it did not end exactly as as i expected and i was even more delighted by how it did.truly fabulous episode. wish i could say more. gotta watch it.\",\"these animation shorts are packed with action and style. each has a distinct animation style and draws you into its own atmosphere and emotion.the storytelling is tight! these are short, 10-15 minutes but the stories and atmosphere are so distilled that it leaves you almost shell shocked. some episodes are gratuitous action, some are horror, some lean to comedy or cyberpunk or film noir. for me, the most striking episodes are the ones that ooze horror (in vaulted halls entombed, bad travelling), and the ones that are abstract and almost poetic (the very pulse of the machine, zima blue, jibaro). there's a number of these shorts that are more stimulating and memorable than many full-length movies, probably because the short form allows the creators to take risks and pack more creativity that any big budget production would allow.\",\"while i wouldn't stop pestering my friends to pick up and watch this anthology during the first season, i am extremely disappointed in the second season. not a single story is worth remembering and is just a graphical showcase at best. skip the second season like the plague!\",\"i think that this series of netflix based on .. what if secenario ...\\none thing for sure is ... i want more .....\",\"i saw the trailers before and i was very exited to see this series.\\nthe last few days i was way too busy to watch netflix so i was very happy when i opened netflix today and saw that the first season i available. i watched the whole season in one go and i regret nothing.the nudity:\\nto me it feels like the makers here had to hold back all nudity and sexual content they wanted to show in the past and tried to compensate for all that int this series.\\nwell, in \\\"the witness\\\" even i thought that it was a little much, but whatever.\\ni saw some reviews of people that seemed disgusted by the nudity, but i think those people don't even look at their own naked body in the mirror. if you have a problem with (female) breasts and nipples, you should stay with the 99% of shows and films where you don't see those. otherwise, this is a show for adults anyway.the gore:\\nsome episodes are very brutal. because of this, i would only recommend this series for people who can stomach that and it's definitely nothing to show to children.the stories:\\nit is hard to classify, having all these very unique episodes. some episodes are really something to think about, others are more .. simple.\\nthe first episode for example has no sophisticated story, but has great visuals and sound. the second one is more simple and and funny, while the third one does seem to try to surprise the watcher, but even a very easy distracted guy like me could see the ending within the first minute, even though there was almost at least one pair of shaking breasts every ten seconds throughout the whole episode. in my opinion the episode \\\"zima blue\\\" had the best story.the visuals:\\nsome of the episodes (1: \\\"sonnie's edge\\\", 7: \\\"beyond the aquila rift\\\", 10: \\\"shape-shifters\\\", 11: \\\"helping hand\\\", 13: \\\"lucky 13\\\" and 18: \\\"the secret war\\\") had extremely great animation quality. most of the other episodes had nice art styles, too. those very well animated episodes just fit my personal taste the best and you could see the great amount of work that has been put into it. i would love to see a complete series based on one or more of those episodes.overall:\\nthis series is great for people like me, who watched tv series as a child and who now would like to see more grownup content, without the limitations that are placed to reach a wider audience. it's surely not for everybody, but i'm pretty sure that there is a very big audience who would love to see more of this and the reviews i'm reading here are telling me the same.\",\"season one is great and season two is almost all garbage.\",\"every story is best of the best. well selected, with depth, with focus and with efforts made. i repeatedly watch them according to my mood.truly hope season 3 is on the way!!!!!\",\"don't watch season 2 with expectations there is only disappointment in season 2 only one time watchable soul is missing in season 2 only 2 episodes are good other episodes not up to the mark.in season 1 the animation, story, directions and concepts are well and top notch while coming to season 2 only disappointment there is no new predictable stories one time watchable.\",\"extremely strong last episode with mythical motives! the river lady called \\\"samodiva\\\" played the perfect role! the bulgarian folklore song vocal was amazing!\",\"the series that came out of nowhere, ti leave me with my mouth open completely, it would really be little to say that the animation of these shorts is good, because it is simply fantastic. the episodes themselves treat a different story with a different style of animation, i must admit that not all the shorts were my taste and i even found them pretentious, but at no time they left me bored or waiting for more, the animation was incredible in each one of them, especially the last chapter, which i consider the best.something quite new and unique, entertaining and of excellent quality.\",\"(this is a review i made for myself to read one day, it is based 100% on my opinion, and should not be taken as a serious criticism)maybe i love this series so much because it's one of the first ones i watched, and that was part of my personality, it made me think about the time, and every time i watch it i think again, for those who are actually going to watch each episode, i guarantee that at least in one of the episodes you will be able to relate your life, the episodes can be interpreted in different ways, from the most literal as \\\"he sold himself for money\\\", to \\\"he abandoned his own innocence and dreams, because the pressure along with ambition forced her\\\", and to improve the series, everything takes place in the same universe, for me it will be an eternal 10.\",\"i didn't know what to expect when stepping into love, death + robots, but i certainly didn't think i'd feel blown away and left wanting more after every episode.each episode is beautifully written; the animation quality, music score and acting make each episode an individual masterpiece.\",\"second season totally 1 star each.2nd season was good only cgi tech as taste as video games cause by blur studio.finally this good production turned on wasting of time.\",\"i stumbled across this series 1 night when scrolling netflix and am in disbelief at how good it is. every episode is unique in its own right and every storyline sucks you in. i love how short and to the point the episodes are so no part of the story feels drawn out or stale. only reason it didn't get a flawless 10 was for the episodes about yogurts and the dump. not that they were bad, but could have been alot better. overall a fantastic watch and i am very excited for season 2 already.\",\"first things first ...\\ni gave it 5 stars just because its animation...\\nits animation is at its best but ...\\nit has shown too much violence in some episodes ....\\nit doesn't have a good storyline ...\\nif they used this level of animation in a good storyline then it would be super great ...\\nbut really hats off to the animation team.\",\"first of all, just to get it out of the way. the animation in essentially every episode is phenomenal. it's easy to let the diverse visual spectacle sweep you up. with that said, story is really the key element, and while the first season ranges well through hard-hitting emotion, thrills, horror, and comedy with masterfully executed differences in pacing from tale to tale, the second season lacks in both of these categories. you just don't have enough time to develop any real connection to comedy or tragedy or intensity, and i think that's a testament to how much difference 8 minutes can make in a story. even more to the point, the 1st season was a solid 18 episodes while the 2nd season doesn't even meet half that at 8 which just isn't enough for the short story style. overall, i do like the show, but if their next set of entries is as lackluster and short as the 2nd season, i can see the show losing its darling status among viewers.\",\"every story is unique set with it's own beautiful animation that helps tells it's story.\\nit feels as if netflix chose individual, talented, minor artists and gave them a chance to shine.\\nno story is the same and neither is the animation style.\\ncannot recommend this enough, you must watch it all at least once!\",\"all episodes of season 1 is so good. story is crazy as well as most of them are dark.some of them are like animated version of back mirror episodes.short episodes so binge worthy.\",\"when i saw this on netflix, i admit i was skeptical. i thought it might go down the way of some of netflix's other animated shows (which can be very hit-or-miss). when i saw the reviews, i was still skeptical, so thought i would give it a go.just watched the first few episodes straight through and the reviews check out. for me it came off a lot like a ken lieu compilation of short stories, with each piece delivering as much wonder and captivation as the one before.i would give this show 9\\u002f10, but the innovation behind the idea, as well as the animation, easily bump it up to a 10.\",\"it was disturbing sometimes, which wasn't bad thing for me, because i was ready for taking any kind of thing.it unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology.it's one of the best series of the last years due this uniqueness. since is treating and telling story and problems about the actual or near future society and the dark side of technology you have to consider that every single episode is a reflection and meditation starting point that most of the time can let the viewer with a sad sensation or let with a bitter taste.each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. the stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. this show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world.\",\"i loved this series from the first episode and looked through all episodes in one breath. i definitely recommend this as a great product.\",\"some of the episodes were alright, but most of them feel like they finish midway. the series is an interesting idea, but i believe the episodes should have been more than 10 minutes long on average, so you could have some sort of character development.\\nthe show tries to pull off a vibe like the prequel and sequel to the 10 minute story are left to be interpreted by the viewer, but only a few episodes successfully accomplish this task in a decent and open-minded way.\",\"it's really freaking weird. but it's very unpredictable and i was constantly caught off guard. that's what made it fascinating to me the way a dystopian should. however, animations talking about and having sex along with the animated nudity was over the top for me and i felt like the show didn't need it.\",\"love this show.... i wonder was season 2 is so short. i wish it was longer.. great episodes. great variety. definitely kept my attention!\",\"normally i wouldn't be cool with people calling something classic\\u002fmasterpiece so soon after it releases. but in this case i absolutely agree. this will be the benchmark for every animated project that will come out in the future.\",\"after the first 2 seasons, was really looking forward to the next installment. big was i let down. cannot go wrong with the 3 robots and the swarm episode wasn't too bad but some real stinkers in there.\",\"this is one of the most spectacular works of creativity i have ever seen. i have seen the whole series multiple times and still notice things i missed in prior viewings.it is a great privilege that we are getting a second collection. the day it comes out i will be stopping everything i'm doing and watching it.update: lowered rating for 10\\u002f10 to 6\\u002f10, due to the extremely terrible season 2. i don't know what went wrong, but holy hell was it bad. it was like a collection of disguarded pixar shorts that just didn't make the cut. no compelling stories. no originality. what a tragedy. the creators of this show should be ashamed. season 2 was atrocious.\",\"when i watched the first season my mind was blown, and then i got on with my life, then new notification in netflix! s02 is coming! i was so excited, and after i watched it in one session i can truly say, oh my god! not gonna spoil but wow wow wow!!!!!! i wish netflix would make a lot more contact like this\\nthe last episode was crazy sad. this series is a true wonder! go and watch it now.\",\"i really liked season 1 of the series: a new kind of format, amazing graphics, sometimes thought provoking and serious, even dark, sometimes just simply funny. diverse themes and animation styles. it was kind of like black mirror, but animated. or like reading a collections sci-fi short stories.but season 2... i was looking forward to it so much, and it let me down. the animations are as good as in season 1, and there is one or two episodes that are kind of ok, but otherwise they have forgotten *the* most important thing that made season 1 so good: the stories. i don't know what they were thinking, but they are very basic in season 2, sometimes do not even make sense. the punch lines are basically missing, or very weak.season 1 = 10 starts. season 2 = 3 stars.\",\"unless some people get slapped in the face they don't know they've been hit. while i wish there were more episodes in season 2 what we get is deeply nuanced raising thoughts provoking questions about who we are and where we are heading, beautifully realised in cg. pure art!\",\"the theme of each story is based around the title, love, death & robots making this for an interesting watch to say the least. reminiscent of mtv's liquid television or other curated animated short films from yesteryear, the admiration of the art alone can not be ignored.\",\"season 2 is not good. i've already watched 5 episodes and none are really interesting. the animation is better in season 2, but the stories suck. when i watched season 1, i kind of skipped past the first episode, and then i watched episode 2. oh boy. the best mini episode i've ever seen and i even had chills at it's ending. wow. but season 2? i have no such feeling. even michael b jordan's story was lame. i wish it was better. like i said, the animation deserves an award, and the directing is actually pretty good. it's just the stories are bad.\",\"with the many styles of animation as well as the huge variety of story this series is a constantly unveiling surprise. the topics range from video-game like slashers, but always with a clever twist, to very funny vignettes to significant social commentary. i have enjoyed every episode immensely and i am still only about half-way through the series. i also like that they are short and sweet, only about 20min an episode, but so far each is a perfectly well-rounded story. if you love sci-fi and animation this series is gold.\",\"there are maybe 2 episodes that are decent. the rest of the episodes gave shallow stories and are littered with overt sexual themes and violence. their favorite is sexual violence towards straight white males. stereotypes are everywhere in the series and the message is clear: straight white men are the devil and should be brutalized.\",\"it's more or less a 7 but it deserves a 6 to set the record straight. the series in general is not bad but it has some very severe flaws.1. the animation is inconsistent and often annoying. for the first 2 or 3 episodes and 2 or 3 episodes after those it's incredible but it often devolves into extremely low frame rate or low effort.2. the stories in 80% of the cases are extremely primitive or undeveloped. only in 2 or 3 episodes i felt they were complete stories. in most other cases they felt like undeveloped pitches.3. the characters are in most cases extremely uninteresting. maybe the animation in most cases plays a role too.\",\"watching this anthology of shorts, some of which are very short indeed, feels a lot like reading an old heavy metal magazine. as a teenager, i used to devour these collections of science fiction, fantasy and horror stories that usually featured sex and nudity and frequently violence and gore, sometimes both on the same page.netflix essentially created an animated version of these pulpy, yet often beautifully illustrated comic books. l, d & r is just as hit-and-miss, just as violent and sexually titillating (for a straight male audience, that is), and, every once in a while, just as artistically beautiful. i just wish it had something to say, or at least a few compelling stories to tell. it all felt a bit shallow and very derivative underneath the flashy exterior. i'm afraid sci-fi fans looking for truly original ideas will be rather disappointed.\",\"it is one of the best mind opening show which hits in a very serious yet lesser known issue to humankind. technology is a boon for us but it can be a bane it not kept in check.\\na must watch!!\",\".............waste of timei wish i had read some of the other comments about this show earlier. i mean the ones that say it's awful and a waste of time. that's what it is.never wrote a review before. but this is far too overrated. please use your time for one of the many good productionsi am sure you can find a lot of movies of people \\\"meeting\\\" animals.. if you are into this stuff. but even if you like this show, please don't trick people into watching this with your rating.......\",\"can't quite remember ever watching a series where each one hour episode left such a powerful impression. loved it.\",\"extremely offensive, over the top violence and as per usual in a modern series too much sex.\",\"i have enjoyed every episode in this anthology series. some more than others. some made me laugh. some made me squirm. if you are a fan of adult sci-fi (and in some cases i mean adult) then definitely give it a shot. the average episode is no longer than 15 minutes, so it won't take up too much of your time.\",\"this futuristic series is just amazing. most of the story line are unique, not something that you've watch a lot of times. i love how they try subtly connect the episodes. i can't say much because you have to watch it to know how good this is. :)\",\"this is magnum opus for anthology artists. can not stop think about this series, perfect.\",\"i watched the whole show in one session when i visited my best friend last week. i heard a lot of positive feedback before so i was pretty excited to watch it. i was hooked by the first episode within the first 5 minutes. great animation great story and one hell of a plot twist. when episode two started i got behind the concept of the show with every episode being an independent kinda short movie. you could almost see every episode like a teaser trailer. and hell yeah these are some of the craziest teasers i ever seen. almost every episode could be a full length movie or a series on its own. the animation work is top notch from beginning to end and the story ideas are very innovative and diversified. as soon as one episode ended i couldn't help but ask myself what the next one will be like. i really liked the fresh concept of this show and i hope there will be more such projects in near future.\",\"this is a great anthology series, partly because the episodes are so short and digestible, and mostly because the animation is so astounding.\\nevery episode has a different art style, and some of the hyper realistic ones are almost indistinguishable from reality. i would say the show is worth the watch even if you just appreciate art and want to watch some in motion.however, just because you have a great aspect; does not mean you can skimp on the rest of what makes a show good. i think many episodes in this series truly skimped on story, with inconclusive, abrupt endings that just didn't feel right. some episodes had no story whatsoever, which was supplemented with comedy sometimes, but other times i felt like my time was almost wasted.considering the art style alone is enough to spend 10 minutes, even the less eventful episodes were not a total lose.the kind of show you should watch alone and just appreciate it, you will identify with different episodes than i did, and the show covers a pretty wide spectrum of themes and genres. recommend the watch, but for the more simple watchers or story lovers, this may miss the mark.\",\"season 2 was really disappointing, stories did make me feel anything. a lot of them seemed like cliché hollywood movies with bad endings. why were there only 8 episodes, it looks like they weren't even try to tell stories as good and mind bending as season 1. i have never been let down more than this. when i saw the trailer i was pumped but wow season 2 is trash.\",\"loved season 1 and was so looking forward to season 2. after watching season 2 in like 40 minutes, i would have to say i'm highly disappointed. only 8 episodes with only maybe 3 decent shorts. feels like a big let down (like got's last season). have a big build up and it just falls flat.\",\"this is must watch sci fi series n full of surprises n thrill\",\"with few highs, mostly low and drag.. season 2 is not the sequel match to its predecessor. animation or graphics are really the holding point otherwise storyline isn't as gripping as it was in every episode of first season.\",\"this show is a sci-fi fans dream. this is now my favorite animated series. the art showcased here is absolutely breathtaking! the stories have some amazing sci-fi concepts that were a lot of fun. i really hope netflix produces more of this type of content.\",\"this is the best i've ever seen on netflix. stunningly original there isn't a story that didn't hold me captivated. a true 10\\u002f10.\",\"i'm glad, i came across this. just shows, you don't need 3 hrs of runtime to occupy a viewer's thoughts and entertain all the same\\nperfect edge of the seat stuff. the pilot just sold it. i had never imagined anything like the pilot would come on screen one day.\\nif you don't like any episode you can just switch to another. it's that simple. just give it 15 mins to set it up though\",\"after a fantastic first season, which had great animation and cgi, creative and thought-provoking stories, and stellar voice acting; we now have season 2. season 1 had a modest 18 shorts, whereas season 2 only has only 8 episodes. season 2 is still a really solid season, which offers some of the best episodes in the show, like pop squad and snow in the desert, but it's lacking the content that season 1 had.and since some of these shorts are so good, i really i hope that netflix turns some of these episodes into full length movies or tv series. stories like pop squad, beyond the aquila rift, the secret war, and snow in the desert are simply too good to be 20 minutes or shorter. aside from that, love, death & robots is a great show. it pushes the boundaries of cgi technology and it offers some really cool looking animation. now i'm just hoping that we get more content if there's a season 3.\",\"love, death and robots isn't for everyone. it's gratuitously violent, salacious to a fault, and not politically correct. and that's exactly what hollywood needs to do more of. no, it doesn't need to make films that are violent, over-sexed or obscene (it's already doing that). it needs to stop making things 'for everybody.' ld&r is obviously going to offend or turn off some, but that's because it's not made for them. but for those who have been waiting for a true animated version of heavy metal magazine, then this is for you. it's got cyberpunk, odd fiction, silly stories and all the sci-fi you could possibly want. what's more, each story is really well made (unlike some attempts to bring heavy metal to film). if you like short films, cg, sci-fi or adult swim, you're not going to want to miss love, death & robots.\",\"season 1 was very good, with 2 really top quality stories.season 2 was a somewhat a disappointment.season 3 was totally wow with an oscar worthy animated story at the end, as well as 2 other top quality episodes. just 1 episode was average.\",\"i really like love, death & robots but it's not perfect show, it has its flaws.the animation is always incredible, i just wish they put more effort into the stories; it's like the stories are just there to keep it chugging along while it gives you an \\\"animationgasm\\\".it's a beautiful series from a visual point of view, but the episodes lack the substance they need for it to feel like a really satisfactory watch. a lot of the episodes just end abruptly and leave me feeling underwhelmed despite the amazing art work.a lot of the episodes in volume 3 are very gore-orientated, which gets a bit tiresome after a while. i don't mind a bit of gore, but there's only so many times i can see someone getting ripped apart, guts flying everywhere and heads being crunched into oblivion before i get bored. the first series is the best for me because there was a lot more variety about it, still, the other two series have got a couple of good episodes as well.it's a good show overall - different, creative, and much more alluring than most crap out there these days. i just wish they'd work on the storytelling and (like the first volume) weave in a few more light, upbeat episodes so you've got a more rounded anchor of genres instead of 80% carnage and bloodshed.\",\"a friend recommended this show a while ago and to pass the time in between new twin peaks episodes we decided to binge this series. the first season kept us hooked really well. original writing, super sharp editing, decent acting and class. the next few episodes in season 2 were still good and exciting. a lot of nice atmosphere, which i love.but when season 3 started everything seemed different. it went from clever to mediocre acting and shallow writing. and these predictable plots are worked out in an action-for-the-sake-of-action package. so then we lost interest. the page turner effect vanished somehow, it's almost like the later episodes are student films, which is a shame really, i'd prefer it if shows just stopped when the inspiration is gone. nevertheless, the first two seasons are definitely worth a watch.\",\"amazing but why everything need to be with nudity and skinny girls???!\",\"the only drawback is they're too short not leaving enough time for a fuller story. but the graphics and acting are top notch. netflix has a winner here. if they have a second season i'd vote for a shorter 10 episode 30 minutes per season.\",\"season 1 and 2 is great,but season 3,4 and 5 are rubbish!\",\"doom and gloom, pretentious in your face liberal propaganda are littered everywhere in this sci-fi horror fantasy series. it does not bother about the nuance of both arguments made by pro-2nd amendment advocates, climate change 'deniers' skeptics, and support for strong us borders. the show already decided that not only are these people wrong but they are fools, idiots, and morons that will be solely responsible for destroying the planet and their demise is comedic.there is nothing really new here. the visuals and animation are great but storywise something that has not already been done in previous sci-fi like heavy metal, hp lovecraft, and various shows like the twilight zone, the outer limits and various syndicated sci-fi horror programs from the 80s.\",\"not sure whether most of the reviews here are fake or from affiliates (netflix paid websites where reviews are so bad written) ... to be clear: the rating is for season 6 only, previous seasons are ***** ... okay: while the original seasons where really dystopian and original, this netflix acquired content is really bad - a waste of life time. we stopped in the middle of no.4 ... the first episode, called \\\"joan is awful\\\" is still quite good (although during the end there are some smaller logic errors) - never mind, it's exactly in the tradition. then the loch episode - er, wtf and the human android at home stuff ... hahaha, everywhere netflix promotion ... just skip it.\",\"the majority of these shorts are both predictable and needlessly edgy. the amount of cringe-worthy cursing and pointless nudity is crazy.save yourself some time and watch the good shorts: lucky 13, zima blue, good hunting, and when the yogurt took over.honestly i have no clue how some of these were even written. it's a shame that such a good genre was dumbed down to the most simplistic and one dimensional shorts ever created.\",\"s03 did not disappoint.in my opinion great art, exciting storytelling. get the sense that these are the kinds of things you get when you do not interfear with the creative team and their vision. some episodes are really different from... anything. the only other show right now i would compare this to is black mirror.\",\"words can't really express how i enjoyed this show, it was just amazing. the animation was unique in each short, and even those who used similar animation such as shapeshifters, secret wars and beyond the aquilla belt, all had unique direction, plot and writting style that made it all stand out on it's own. speaking of writting, every episode was fun beggining to end and some could even become series on their own. hopefuly there will be a season 2 with more shorts and new directors and animators. seeing shows like ldar, dragon prince and the upcoming klaus movie, seems like netflix is giving modern animation the finger and investing on everything that have love and care every frame.\",\"i didn't even know i needed this in my life but thank god it has come and this is the greatest thing netflix has ever given me, my only negavtive is that the episodes should be longer! i need more and more and asap\",\"i lowered my rating after seeing season 2 because\\nthe new 8 episodes were not as shocking, spooky, violent nor as sexy as the first season was. and after an 18 episode first season... given they average only 9 minutes long this season, is a big disappointment. it's not even a full hour long... again it's good and my original rating was a 9 for season 1 but season 2 is much more benign.\",\"most of the episodes are fantastic, some are not as good\",\"the last ten years have been full of reboots and repetitions. there is something really new here. ideas and concepts that take the mind a little further. that's great.\",\"i love this series. i really hope they make more seasons!!!\",\"i have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. charlie brooker has popped out of the internet at times when i least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program screenwipe and others. that was my first exposure to doug stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. black mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the twilight zone. it is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. i have always been interested in futurists and brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. there is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity. having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories i couldn't disagree more. as the title suggests, brooker's black mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters. there are no blatant soap box messages but i interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. the only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture. beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. the characters and sets create convincing realities and i was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. i could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. congratulations to brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us.\",\"it's just that good! i really like how it is an anthology series so the episodes are completely unrelated. you can literally watch the last episode and not spoil anything! just pop it on netflix read the synopsis and choose the one you want to watch depending on the mood you are in. extremely good show! very addicting and very well thought out! the actors all do a terrific job! the directing is on-par. the cinematography, breath-taking, the color palette... everything. this show is extremely dark, i can not stress this enough, you never know what you are in for... it takes you on one hell of a ride and doesn't let up! i can not believe i slept on it. possibly the best show on netflix, highly addicting and highly recommended! 5 stars +\",\"this is an interesting series of short films.some are very good, some not so good, but overall well worth watching.some of the stories are funny, some have got a serious message and some are just plain weird.i think that it better to binge watch a few episodes at a time to help to get you \\\"in the mood\\\".i've seen the first two series and will watch the third in a week or so and so far there has only been two episodes that i didn't really like, but that is just my point of view.

me. definetely go for it\",\"love, death & robots is a visually stunning anthology series created by netflix to showcase different types of animation and the different stories that can be told through them. the first 3 seasons are ambitious in a way that pushes the technology the animators are suing to the absolute limit. all the episodes (approx. 20 minutes long) are very different in animation style, but a very unique in how they use the animation to tell a story that can only be told using animation. some of the episodes are very bloody and gory, creating a very cerebral experience for the audience. i would recommend this show to someone who appreciates the hard work behind animation, or a brave soul who is looking for something to expand their mind of film.\",\"i love sci-fi. i love horror. i love dark comedies. this show is definitely for me. most of the ideas are interesting. most of the episodes are good-great. some are mediocre or bad. but the reason to watch this show are a

animation.but what lacks is story and depth. expected though when each episode has a runtime of about 15 minutes and the fact that every episode is an entirely different story. the problem with this is that you never really get past just watching it for the visuals, knowing the story will end with a somewhat predictable twist or event. i hope season 2 extends their episodes to 30 minutes, and really go beyond just visual spectacle.season 2 update:\\nletdown of a season with a increase of quantity at the cost of quality.season 3 update:\\nback to why most of us loved the show when it came out. fantastic cgi and neat little short films. though there is a big focus on gore this season and after a while it becomes uninteresting. also this season lacked storytelling. most of it was just way too simple. jibaro, the final episode, wins with it's insane creative expression, the directing style is chaotic but so, so visually enthralling. noticeably from the same studio as season one ''the witness'' and you can tell instantly. i do think the directing was better fitted there than in jibaro.\",\"season one had multiple episodes that where masterpieces.intruiging ideas and plot twists.i had to redo my review and adjust it down to 6 now with season 2.that was a total let down, after the hype when i saw the trailer for season 2.boring stories, and it felt incredible short.everyone has a different taste and thats good, otherwise the world would be pretty boring, but i only liked two episodes of the season.not to mention that sometimes the credits and intro felt longer then the actual rest of the episode!everyone who likes short stories should check out the channel \\\"dust\\\" on youtube.and maybe the writers and producers of season 2 should have get a little more inspiration from there too ...lets hope season 3 will become better if twe ever get a third one....\",\"what a great serie i loved it every chapter is a whole new roller coster of emotion\",\"in under 30 minutes, every episode of this netflix' animated anthology is like a short trip to your wildest imagination and fantasy. amazing episodes like \\\"sonnie's edge\\\" that

and mass effect have a baby with a spine-chilling twist plus animated hottie like miranda lawson, and \\\"secret war\\\", an episode with metro and doom series vibe, all wrapped in an 18+ nsfw. minus

animator and artist, i can say that i really appreciated the various styles of animation in the series - varying from cutting edge to some pretty limited\\u002fstylized animation. a special shout out to digic for their episode - some of the most impressive shading and simulation i've seen - just jaw-dropping stuff.the stories are varied, but mostly predictable, and pretty much all center around violence of some kind. if you remember heavy metal magazine, well, you'll have a good feel for most of the stories. my biggest gripe with the series was the out of place and in-your-face gratuitous nudity, profanity, and gore. it made the series feel like a political\\u002fcultural (sjw) statement more than a series of *stories*. yes, those elements have a specific place in specific stories - but most of these episodes felt like they started with an agenda and tried to wrap a story around it - even if it kept jarring the viewer out of their sense immersion.i despise this kind of film-making - it's political, simplistic, shallow, and amateur - everything that will give this a very short shelf-life. what a waste of talent. c'mon guys - you're better than this!8 stars for the technical aspects. -7 stars for the stories and adolescent use of excessive sjw dog whistles and nudity\\u002fprofanity. given netflix's pushing of all things culturally degrading, i'm not surprised -

perfections, my god!\",\"after an incredible season one, it appears that the producers of ld+r. caved in to the harsh criticism that there was-- too much female nudity-- in the initial season. so provocative stories in seasons two and three were clearly sanitized to appease the critics rather than appeasing the taste of the audience that loved the first season so much!so it now appears that the writers, directors, and producers of the animated series attempted to compensate for the reduction in eroticism and graphic nudity by increasing the amount of profanity and graphic violence. and it really didn't work, imo.i initially rated the series as a nine. but now i rate it at 8.its still a good series with some provocative and interesting stories. but subsequent seasons will never be as good as the first season if the series continues to appease the political anti-sex league (orwell's 1984).\",\"the second volume lacked every single aspect that the first brought to the table. kinda disappointing. 8 episodes compared to the 18 that was the first season. blood, love sex and head trips none existent in the second. overall super sub par. i'll re watch the first volume.\",\"three words : love , death , robots.\\nits a fresh new project that takes influence from various sci fi writers and directors.season one had short stories with mind bending plot twists , brilliant

more episodes, please. i'm done watching all 19 episodes and i must say it was amazingly done in all aspects of the film. the 19 episodes were all great. the actors, the director, the writer, the setting, the involvement of technology & innovation, and the moral lessons we learned. i think if you're a person who is into technology and appreciates how it works, you will surely relate to each episode. the common ground is the technology and innovation. how it could affect our living today and in the future. all stories have a basis or common logic and who knows it could really happen to you in the future. you have to be open-minded and understand the logic of technology in order to understand and relate yourself to each story. i think all 19 episodes were my favorite ones. by the way, i work as a freelance web developer and really into online games and technology and latest innovation, so i really like and appreciate this kind of show. very refreshing and new. also, the casts were great. i like the idea of mixing famous actors and newbies. it's always nice to see new faces on the screen. kudos black mirror! i want more episodes for the next season please! :)\",\"fantasy monsters getting killed with big guns... if you find that interesting, then you are as shallow as these nonsense episodes with hardly any dialog, or deeper meaning, but just very good cgi. video games have good cgi too, especially intros, and this show feels just like a bunch of pointless intros, a total waste of time, with lots of violent killing of monsters.ofc with so many episodes, some very few are funny, like the rat problem at a farm, going over the top :)\\nbut this show is neither funny or exciting, and the promising start of each episode you hope can be interesting, just ends terrible.i have ofc not seen season 2, as those who said season 1 was a 10 of 10, said season 2 was very weak...a serious red flag...since i have seen most of season 1 at least, and i have seen 3 episodes that was recommended of season 3. that included soldiers who were werewolves on both american and taliban side, in afghanistan. yes, another showdown to death, as this is the main theme in this show, but this time with werewolves fighting each other to death, instead of alien like monsters...\\nwhat really scares me are those calling this violent killing of monsters with big guns a 10 of 10, and art because cgi technology is very good now...sounds to me they have played too many violent videogames?\",\"really loved it! i don't have a favorite episode every single one of them is unique and intriguing.\",\"ground breaking stylish animation undercut by simplistic, objectifying and sexist plotting. half-baked. saturated with jingoistic violence, gratuitous sex, nudity and nihilism. rather tone deaf in its willingness to blindly celebrate these themes rather than examine them with any degree of intelligence. characters are cartoonish in their motivations and responses, failing to react in a recognisably human (or intelligent) way to their situations but instead picking from a short list of tired stereotypes -- usually grunt, sex object or both. disturbing, but only in the sense that you hoped removing inhibitions might lead to something fresh whereas it feels a lot more like a poorly developed male teen fantasy. the overall experience is like the old animated \\\"heavy metal\\\" movie which frankly today is just embarrassing to watch. each episode feels like a long video game cut-scene with no skip button. a few interesting twists appear but they don't make up for the rest. ultimately sterile and disappointing.\",\"i guess the idea for each episode a story is good. it is true that stories are short and full of violence, but you can understand the

and technology and gives a slight glimpse into how things could end up being. each episode is it's own story line and there is almost always a great plot twist by the end. although i enjoy the show it

episode about some sort of obvious dangerous and killing piece of technology, or an episode about different aspects of technology that we already know, but just with some subtle twists or different perspectives? episodes that don't tell you what to think, but let you think. episodes that don't scream \\\"technology is awful\\\" but tell a story about... people. people and technology. that's what season 5 delivers.\",\"i didn't expect much from love death and robots but the series still got me a dissapointing thought when i watch a series i expect that every element has a porpurse i expect that it has themes that explores and i try to reflect that when i watch movies or series but when a series doesn't have that it's ok i will have more low standards but you still have to develop write the characters create the scenes that complement the story you need world building etc etc this elements can be explore in more depth then others but this series feels like a 15 year old teenager that thinks a concept will be enough to cover all the elements that a movie\\u002fseries has to have the animation it's impressive but it gets stale really quickly when it doesn't have porpurse more than look pretty the things that death love and robots try to explore are extremely juvenile and the execution it's worse there's no time to attach to nothing there's no time to explore the concepts and there's no time to even in a superficial level say a message and to compare it to a more recent series (at least for 3 seasons) its black mirror, black mirror has a concept and develop it's it has coherent story telling it has a point and even if some episodes comes as a mess or pretencious the concept is develop enough to be consider watchable , maybe you can say that i'm judging too hard and it's time limitations doesn't have the possibility to explore this concepts but in reality this concept were made to have this duration in mind the time doesn't excuse the porpurse of art and this series wastes all the things it has in advantage and destroys it in conclusion this series is a trainwreck but if i have to give credits the writing is on point (even if is awfully estructure and it has no porpuse) the animation is really well made in some shorts and it can be charming at times but this things are limited compare to the ocean of garbage this mini series gave me\",\"a mix between sci-fi, thriller, drama and sarcastic comedy depicting a possible future and sometimes the very present moment of our society. the evolution and possibles scenarios of the merging between humans and technology.\\ni love this series\",\"as much as i wanted more in season two, it's hard to not see this as beautiful in every way. absolutely stunning visual art, music, voice acting, cgi (of course), and overall pure art in digital form. my hat is off to all of the creators of this masterpiece of a series.\",\"love, death & robots, an anthology series created by tim miller and david fincher, is a captivating collection of animated short stories that pushes the boundaries of imagination and storytelling. with its unique blend of diverse themes, stunning animation, and thought-provoking narratives, the series manages to leave a lasting impression on viewers. this review aims to explore the reasons why love, death & robots deserves a solid 9\\u002f10 rating.one of the standout aspects of this anthology is its ability to seamlessly weave together various genres, ranging from science fiction and fantasy to horror and comedy. each episode takes the audience on a different journey, allowing them to explore distinct worlds and experience a wide range of emotions. whether it's the adrenaline-fueled action of \\\"suits\\\" or the mind-bending existentialism of \\\"beyond the aquila rift,\\\" love, death & robots consistently delivers fresh and compelling narratives that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.the animation in love, death & robots is nothing short of breathtaking. each episode presents a unique visual style, showcasing the incredible talent and creativity of the animation teams involved. from the hyper-realistic cgi in \\\"good hunting\\\" to the visually stunning 2d animation in \\\"zima blue,\\\" the series demonstrates a remarkable attention to detail and a willingness to experiment with different artistic techniques. the visuals not only enhance the storytelling but also serve as a feast for the eyes, creating a truly immersive experience.another strength of love, death & robots lies in its ability to explore profound and thought-provoking themes within the constraints of a short format. despite each episode's limited runtime, the series manages to delve into complex ideas such as artificial intelligence, the nature of consciousness, the fragility of human existence, and the consequences of technological advancements. these stories often leave viewers pondering the moral and ethical implications of the worlds presented, sparking deep discussions and contemplation.moreover, the series excels at showcasing a diverse range of characters and perspectives. love, death & robots embraces inclusivity and does not shy away from addressing social issues, be it gender identity, race, or sexuality. by incorporating a wide spectrum of human experiences, the series manages to create relatable and authentic characters that resonate with viewers on a personal level, fostering empathy and understanding.while love, death & robots generally succeeds in delivering exceptional episodes, there are instances where the quality can be inconsistent. due to the anthology format, some stories may resonate more strongly with viewers than others, and occasional dips in narrative depth or pacing may occur. nevertheless, these minor shortcomings do not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment and impact of the series.in conclusion, love, death & robots is a tour de force of animated storytelling. its ability to seamlessly blend genres, stunning animation, thought-provoking themes, and diverse perspectives make it an absolute gem in the realm of anthology series. while it may not be perfect in every aspect, its overall excellence is undeniable. if you are a fan of imaginative narratives and breathtaking visuals, love, death & robots is a must-watch experience that will leave you craving more.\",\"one second into the first season you immediately get your generic netflix 'girl power' vibes, 'let's yell at the generic antagonized white male and automatically win everything because muh feminism'.waste of resources, but because the animation is pretty awesome and it's violent everyone will love it without thinking twice about how cliche it is for netflix, how senseless the 'plot' is and how it has nothing new or original to offer.it's like a bootleg abc's of death but with a way bigger budget and taking itself way too seriously. as always when it comes to netflix, i knew exactly what to expect and i wasn't pleasantly surprised to see anything new.if you're desperate to watch \\\"strong\\\" female characters with either the skrillex haircut or no hair at all kill \\\"evil\\\" white men in countless different scenarios, and scenes featuring lots of tits and dicks, the dicks often being shot at or damaged because (???) -- make your own conclusions what the agendas are here. as usual netflix is waging a war against men in general, but i did enjoy two of the 18 episodes because they happened to not be sjw trash.\",\"we should be thankful for netflix. no, really, we should. they are taking all risks to produce their own content. sometimes they fail and sometimes they make wonderful things: like love, death & robots.each episode it's interesting in it's own way, with rich

there were a couple other good ones, the werewolf one was pretty good. there certainly aren't as many robots as the title would suggest. overall decent but could have been better.\",\"the first season was just lit. one the most unique and successful animated series with a ( tv-ma) rating. i was eagerly.and .oh my god! what the hell was that? it's stories are so dumb, that we tend to think if we are

commendable effort....this is a must-see if you're a fan of the science fiction genre...\",\"this serie is visually stunning and it really shows the power of animations. almost every episode features very entertaining plots and great soundtracks, definitely one of the best coming out of 2019. one problem with the show is that the show is way too short, as a tv show it almost feels like as if i'm watching youtube videos, i really hope the second season would improve upon that, but it was still a very enjoyable experience.\",\"season 2 of love, death, and robots just really sucks. i wonder how much money the tobacco companies poured into netflix for so much product placement.in many of the episodes the animation is really good, but the story lines are really poor, and in virtually every episode cigarette placement is obvious.i wonder how people would react if this was a diet soda, oreos, or any other product. the near universal smoking in these episodes ruins the entire series.some decent voice acting.overall season 2 just nose dived into the toilet. or should i say nose dived into the ashtray.\",\"after a very strong first season that i'd give 8 or 9 stars, came a much more dissapointing second season. the first season explores several sci-fi scenario's and other strange concepts and reminds me a bit of black mirror. the second season explores a few concepts that seem to barely answer the question that they start on. animation is still strong though.\",\"for the most part, the stories in this anthology series are pretty simple. many have been done before, and a handful do seem to share certain traits. the animation quality, while mostly different from short to short, is spectacular throughout. this show also isn't afraid of showing nudity or gore, which does turn some people away. if you have a weak stomach or you're looking for something more family-friendly, steer clear.the worst part about the series is how a lot of the stories just need more time. there were a handful that were fantastic, but would've been near-perfect if they'd had another twenty minutes or more to develop the characters and flesh out the stories. the short length also hurts the pacing for a few episodes, with everything moving so fast there's not enough time to really feel the atmosphere that the episode is going for. as a result, those episodes feel more like introductions to larger standalone series than one-off episodes in an anthology, and i'm not sure if that makes it better or worse.no matter what, though, this is a great show. not perfect, but still a great time if you're looking for something different from the norm.\",\"all episodes were exceptional imo, in their own way. the quality of animation today is so realistic. i wonder why all movies aren't animated. each episode had it's different characteristics, different story, different kind of animation. but i would watch each story as an entire movie. just fantastic stuff.thank you for your time.\",\"season 2 has been netflixfied, its pc stilted and cautious, if you expecting to be shocked then you would be better of watching a today, this is very bad...\",\"some episodes were extraordinarily good some not so. you have pretty much everything in the whole series. the best thing about them is they are short and because of that you don't lose interest like you can in long winded movies. can't wait to see if they do anymore.\",\"season 1 was almost perfect, season 2 was shorter and had only a few great episodes. but season 3 is well as short as season 2, but every single episode is as good as the best episodes of season 1. i still would want for longer seasons but if i had to choose quality or quantity i'd want quality.good job on everyone working on this incredible show.\",\"maybe it is the whole society, but what is the thing with the humanities seeing disaster in every advancement? just because it might sell better is not an argument, as variety also sells. is it because the ones who end up in humanities, as opposed to sciences are not only usually less intelligent, but also start up in fields that pay far worse. so anything that reinforces their obsolescence in the work market only reinforces the christian mythology about the end of days.the series is unpleasant in taking the ugly side of tech, in an unimaginative context. take the first episode. people can see in a virtual reality hints from their smart phones. yet they still need a big screen just like the young screen writer envied the people having big screen macs back in the day. the technology seemingly surpassed the need for a screen - see the brother emerged in virtual reality - yet the writer can't possibly understand that. or when tesla cars can drive themselves, in this alternative near future the taxi is a taxi and not some sort of uber and has a driver too! so much for visionary.yes, the phones should have been different, but the catalyst of the unimaginative writer incapable to get a science diploma is precisely his fear of a smart phone like the iphone. and the fear is palpable, after all the screen writer probably has a hard time understanding that the russian girl who keeps writing is a scam as the nigerian prince. and jumping from email to enhanced reality is quite a jump for a frail mind.contact me with questions, comments or suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch\",\"10\\u002f10 incredible, amazing, season 1.season 2 was short and the stories weren't as good. the animation in both seasons were spectacular, i still can't believe how well done it was. worth watching!\",\"season 1 had strong stories, every episode was so perfect and had true plots. it was really black mirror in cartoon. 9\\u002f10season 2 wonderful graphics but too poor stories. not even close season 1. really desappointed. 3\\u002f10.\",\"there's a strong video game vibe here, like whoever wrote this was heavy into video games. most stories are the kill-theonster-or-be-killed type. people with guns walking around shooting scary stuff type, and when they kill one bad guy--uh oh, another even badder guy pops up, and now they have to kill the boss for this new level.(one of the better stories of this type, i think, is bad traveling, which had a and then there were none arc which was nice)they're not all like this, i admit, there's some variety, but even then you have to put up with sci-fi cliches and the dialogue which is pretty crude and uninspired.i'm not sure why people seem to enjoy this as much as they do.\",\"reminds us of heavey metal meets screen. quick scifi hits that you won't stop thinking or talking about! bloody awesome and i do mean bloody!\",\"i find i hate most anthologies because there just is not enough to hold one's interest for a full 40 minutes to an hour. the twilight zone was.25 minutes, and i think that is part of the reason i think for its success--it was not too long. there is normally only one thing of interest in most episodes and by the time it is done it has long exceeded my interest in the subject. at worse i only getting a little bored with some of these episodes, never downright bored and frustrated at the episode, just wanting the episode to end. so for me this format works so much better than any other recent anthology.another interesting aspect is that many if not all of these episodes are fully animated, and it is amazing the level of animation that is possible today. some it is obviously animation but sill amazing animation.\",\"each episode builds on a futuristic word where our technology has become highly integrated with our lives. so much so, that many aspects of live have become perverted by the technology. many of the stories are disturbing from the aspect of human interaction and technological interactions. the graphics are great, the technological ideas are believable, and the acting is great.\",\"literally, every single episode should be made into a film.\",\"this was like reading heavy metal magazine for the first time in the early 80s for me.\",\"so as i pointed out in my last review of the show, i thought season 1 was great, it was fresh, new, and gave us some of the most creative short animations we've seen. it actually had decent stories too and wasn't just art style galore.but the creativity and imagination died in season 2, and it was even obvious when they announced that it would only have 8 episodes as opposed to the first 18-episode season. and when season 2 came out, it was what i expected, eye candy with no substance.season 1 had so many different stories with different and visually pleasing animations and they were engaging and fun to watch, and it was a new and different show.but season 2 was boring and not engaging at all, and season 3 is no different, but i still enjoyed it better than season 2.as i said, the only creativity left in the show after season 1 is just the creative mind and imagination of the animators and not the writers.these are for season 3 episodes:\\nepisode 1 of this season is just the same old \\\"haha hoomans dumb\\\" and that's it. can you tell show me where the creativity in that was? did they show something new and told a new story other than \\\"dumb hoomans destroyed themselves?\\\" i'll give it a 5\\u002f10 but i think it's too generous.episode 2 is an exception and why i liked this season more. it's directed by david fincher, so how can it be bad? it had a good runtime and helped it become engaging, unlike the season 2 episodes. it had a great quality of animation, amazing voice acting by the lead, and good direction and cinematography all around. someone mentioned that there was no twist at the end and the episode didn't have the surprise element, and it would've made the episode better. which i kinda agree, the story was told straight with some minor twists, but i still enjoyed it and can watch a full season with just this story and this character alone. solid 9\\u002f10 for me.episode 3 is again all style and eye candy and no substance. there wasn't even a plot or a story there. 6\\u002f10episode 4 was much more enjoyable, short and concise, and did its job of entertaining me. the only story that could've worked in this miniature style was zombies and that's why i don't have a problem with them using a clichéd apocalypse story, as it worked with this style. 7\\u002f10.episode 5 was decent too, but still was only style and action over substance and another story we've seen before. 6\\u002f10episode 6. i didn't enjoy this episode much, the story was decent even though it was the same thing that's been done times and times again. didn't really care for it other than the animation looked good. 6\\u002f10.episode 7 had a cute animation style and the voice acting was good. the story was a little more creative than just your run-of-the-mill apocalypse story and felt pixar-like.episode 8 was whatever. they just mixed some military soldiers with some lovecraftian monster and there was zero suspense and horror. the same spider swarm chasing we've seen in this show a morbilion times and even in previous episodes of this very season. they can do so much more with lovecraftian horror and this is the best they can come up with? i thought there was no limits and boundaries to the imagination when it comes to making animations? 6\\u002f10.episode 9 was nice too and i especially loved the claustrophobic cinematography it had, especially at the beginning. it still had a very simple plot with no dialogues, but i really enjoyed the art style and the cinematography was amazing, and the music at the end was great too. 8\\u002f10if i give season 1 an 8 (an 8.5 or 9 if we're being too generous), i give season 2 a 6 and season 3 a 7. they should've waited a year or two and just combined seasons 2 and 3 together so this way we could have something like season 1 where it had hit or misses but still was good. but since i only enjoyed maybe one or two episodes of season 2, i doubt it would've still compare to season 1.like do you remember zima blue or the witness from season 1? remember that they had creativity in both animating and storytelling?now it's just the same world-ending story they themselves have done multiple times, with a new-looking alien or creature or robot and just a different animation style.like did they use all their budget to hire those famous actors in episode 8 and didn't hire any writers?at the end of the day, these eye candies are just forgettable the moment you finish the whole season. like i just finished the show the only ones i still remember and enjoyed, are the fincher one, the rat one, the zombie one, and the last episode. what's the point of making these forgettable shorts again?if you're gonna do the same story over and over and over again with just a different art style, why not make a... i don't know, multiverse episode or movie and just have a story told in different styles like that yt video \\\"top 100 3d renders from the internet's largest cg challenge\\\"?don't get me wrong, i love this show and i want it to go on forever, but do i really want to see another robot\\u002fa. i\\u002fanimal uprising that destroys human civilization in season 4? no, no i don't.so please, for the next season, if there is one, please hire more creative writers too and make some of the episodes longer to be more engaging.overall, i usually rate these anthology series based on the average of the ratings i gave to each episode. i remember after season 1 i gave it a 9 because it was really good, then the second came and made it an 8 for me, and now season made it a 7, although i adjusted my ratings for season 2 again. but overall, only like 4 episodes out of 9 episodes of this season were fun to watch, so a 7 for the whole season is more than generous.and based on all three seasons and their episodes, the whole show gets a 7 from me. i might enjoy some episodes, but since it's an anthology, you can't compare it to a regular show and ignore the weaker episodes and don't have them affect the rating of the whole show.if season 1 has stories that we've seen before, it can be forgiven as it is a new show and they're just warming up. if the season continues the trend of copying season 1, it still can be forgiven because it's their first time copying themselves, but if season 3 is the same thing again? when is the time to stop? and i'm totally not looking at you westworld and stranger things!!!!like, look at agents of s. h. i. e. l. d. each season, at least after season 3, had a different story, style, and location. it took our protagonists to space, to an artificial world, to time travel for a whole season, and just gave us new things and put our characters in new places and kept it fresh. what did stranger things do? only do the same plot over and over again for 3 seasons? oh ok. and what about westworld? the show that could've become one of the best shows of all time? only turned its philosophical storytelling into a nonsensical futuristic a. i uprising in season 3 and no one talked about that show after it finished just like no one even remembers or talks about got.my point is, if you're gonna just keep doing the same story over and over, it might be better to finish your show than renew it for 6 seasons of repetitiveness. remember when netflix canceled the oa, one of the most creative shows, and kept budgeting trash movies with famous actors and renewing their favorite teenage show stranger things?i will watch this show to the day it stops making new episodes because i enjoy me some quality animation and art style, but i really really hope the next season will be better and more creative than this, but i won't hold my breath.\",\"real entertainment. keep this up netflix its a winner.\",\"this show made me laugh, think and consider the rise of automation in our society.\",\"season 1 is very very good. nice concept,

of this show was extremely good. the stories had a lot of impact and had me anxiously awaiting season 2. unfortunately the second season was a huge letdown in my book, seemingly just a few short

thought-provoking ambiguity replaced by existing or near-future technology. immediately alarming and insightful. as a technologist and father myself, the series easily captures your attention with

anything would be better than s2. the only good episode was the pirate one that fincher actually directed. everything else was some liberal agenda or lacking some semblance of an ending to the story

to enjoy and not bad enough to laugh at, pure mediocrity and a huge disappointment.\",\"** this review contains spoilers **i was trying to find a new series to watch on netflix, and, missing the amazing (but deceptive) jinni, browsed 'similarshows'. this show came up as one of one of four 'mind boggling shows like the x-files'. i never really got into x-files, but quite liked the bits i saw. imdb's score (for bm) was 8.9, so i thought it was well worth checking out.. big mistake. similarshows certainly got the 'mind boggling' aspect right, but they missed the word 'awful'. if only i'd checked the reviews here first, as some share my view and would've warned me. not only was the main theme of the first episode repulsive, it was completely ridiculous. i guess i'm one of those who 'missed the messages... ' '...the relationship between technology and psychology'.. well the tech. fell down for me when they didn't realise a dismembered finger was actually a man's; and as for the psychology: man kidnaps girl, man makes fantastically ridiculous demands, pm says no, one of his staff makes incredibly stupid mistake, his subordinates say he must comply, his wife cries, he decides he will (or more accurately, he's bullied into it), evidence is available to show the man is unlikely to kill the girl but they ignore it, everyone, including the kids, watches 'the act' on national tv, at tea time. 'it' apparently goes on for over an hour, then afterwards they find out that the guy released the girl before the act had begun, then topped himself. maybe i am missing something, but i really can't see much depth to it at all. i found the psychology of 'the fall' deep, immersive and disturbing. not this.i'm not a big fan of watching more of something that's rubbish (imo) just to see if it gets better.. if that's what floats the creators' boats (and a multitude of viewers who thought it was 'outstanding' (as did the emmy's it seems), 'brilliant' and 'the best show ever', i'll jump ship.\",\"\\\"love, death & robots\\\" is a masterclass in storytelling diversity and visual innovation. this anthology series delivers a captivating blend of science fiction, fantasy, and horror across its varied episodes. each installment is a self-contained narrative, offering viewers a glimpse into a unique world crafted with meticulous attention to detail.one of the standout aspects of \\\"love, death & robots\\\" is its stunning animation style, which ranges from hyper-realistic cgi to stylized hand-drawn artwork. this visual diversity enhances the storytelling experience, immersing audiences in worlds both familiar and fantastical.the series explores a wide range of themes, from the implications of advanced technology to the complexities of human nature. despite the disparate settings and storylines, there's a cohesive thread running through each episode, connecting them thematically and emotionally.with its blend of thought-provoking narratives and jaw-dropping visuals, \\\"love, death & robots\\\" is a must-watch for fans of science fiction and animation alike. it pushes the boundaries of storytelling in the digital age, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.\",\"like every other netflix series you get good season 1 .. and bad season 2 .they try their hardest to make a good season 3, but they created blood bath .. wtf was that ...

can only give 1 overall score, which is a 1 yet the short story \\\"zima blue\\\" is a 10 so i've bumped the score to 3. that short story was magnificent and moving. really fascinating. the sexual violence and amateaur comedy was a pass, but the short knocks it out. silver medal to \\\"the giant.\\\"\",\"amazing british anthology series with a very intriguing concept. the premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on tv to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could\\u002fwould evolve in the future. each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). as the show's creator charlie brooker ('dead set') puts it: \\\"...they (the different stories) are all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.\\\"the resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows i've ever come across. the writing and directing are excellent and the cast

one of the best things i've ever watched. not every idea is \\\"original\\\". some of it is homage, some of it just similar in plot or theme to other things that have come before. here's what's important to know: the great majority of these shorts are as good or better than anything and everything that came before. lucky 13, aquila rift, sonnie's edge, it goes on. all have a scifi or fantasy

stories (so far, writing as of finishing volume 3) we average or less, but there were a few gems in there. also, all of the different art styles were amazing to see. a huge problem for me, however, was the volume of each of the episodes. most of them were so quiet that i had to turn my tv up very high, but then on a dramatic part the episodes get so loud i have to lower it, drastically, then raise it again after the scene. i don't know if it's a netflix issue or just my end but it really ruins it for me, especially since they're so short so i have to do it often. also, on netflix, the volumes are listed in opposite order (volume 3, 2, 1) and while the stories don't go together, i wanted to start at volume 1. it's easier if they're in order so i don't have to exit the show at the end of one volume to go to the next. that wasn't part of how i scored this, though. if there is going to be a volume 4, i may watch it, but if the volume thing is universal, please fix that. it highly ruins the experience.\",\"season 1: took me forever to finally come around to watch this show and i gotta say- i like the short anthological episodes a lot more than i expected! the concepts of most of the shorts are super intriguing however i did not enjoy the excessive use of nudity (often without importance to the plot) especially when it was super sexualized. looking forward to the other seasons as i heard they toned it down there. most favorite episode: sonnie's edge \\u002f\\u002f least favorite episode: sucker of soulsseason 2: watching this one day after finishing the first season

beauty like the first season.\",\"i always watch this, i like the format and the creativity but i wish they would spend less time on the looks and more on the stories. all episodes look perfect, 2d or 3d, but the stories are weak and many are predictable and it becomes a nice gallery of animations with few things to tell. it's like looking at some nice nft's :d.for the producers of these episodes i would say: a good story doesn't need so much work. people can easily ignore the lack of a good rendering or animated frames if the story is ok.\",\"10 episodes shorter than the previous season, season 2's episodes feel like teasers, pilots or excerpts from a larger whole that you never get to see. most feel incomplete and while some present interesting and thought-provoking settings, nothing ever

in this terrible ending to make the viewer go \\\"oh no i didn't expect that\\\". this episode didn't need that. it could've done with a calm and beautiful ending, and it would've made much more of a

graphics are excellent, the stories are dark, and i am already waiting for the second season.this is the best animated anthology i've ever seen.. david fincher and tim miller are my new demi-gods.\",\"excellent compilation of animated shorts, with a surprisingly wide range of stories and genres.quality is the word that i think of to best describe this production. the animation is top notch, the episodes are very well written making you will feel entertained and especially engaged throughout the entirety of the season.sure, some episodes are better than others depending on your personal taste, nonetheless the stories are so short and meaningful that is just a pleasure to watch. the themes are also extremely varied, episodes range from world dominating yogurt to self realizing robots.if you are a fan of animation or just looking for some good storytelling, this show is for you,\\nenjoy!\",\"gorgeous animation and interesting stories even if some are similar to one another. i would have gave it 10, but i don't think it passed the bechdel test even once, so i can't give it a perfect score. the stories have different tones and cover a lot of sub genres like steampunk, space opera, etc. almost everery episode is an amazing experience, and i wish there were more.\",\"alright. if you've just watched volume 2 and think it's not too bad, but haven't watched volume 1 recently. seriously go back and watch volume 1 now and you'll see how far short volume 2 fell. i'm doing it now and seriously volume 1 is on another level. another level in every aspect. the stories are more fleshed out, more complete, the have resolutions also. the messages in each episode actually hold a deeper meaning and create introspection. the episodes feel like a complete work. the episodes aren't held back and are allowed to explore whatever the message may be. volume 1 feels like unabashed cult classic and volume 2 fees like watered down pc hollywood. volume 2 is also the exact opposite of all the attributes i described to volume 1. seriously volume 1 was so good because of its unabashed direction for each episode. they didn't back down or give an inch and told their story. volume 2 is like having the dial turned to 3 where are volume 1 is like (spinal tap reference) the dial turned to 11.i guess volume 2 cut out the heart of love, death & robots to appeal to a wider audience perhaps. but it was so so underwhelming. i feel ripped off waiting 2 years for this garbage. seriously 2 years. by the state of volume 2 you would fee it was rushed to capitalize quickly on market demand. it wasn't rushed just ruined by the new direction it's taken by whoever was at the helm of volume 2. volume 2 is not love, death & robots.\",\"overall i love that netflix is doing this and opening up an avenue for new voices, new stories\\u002fstyles and more than anything pushing adult focused animation. the industry has needed this for decades.unfortunately a number of the shows fall into the same old misogynistic tropes of rape as a plot device. the episodes that rely on this didn't need them as central devices or character motivation... any of 100 other origin stories could have worked and would not have lessened the story or execution of it.i'm hopeful that there is a season 2 and that in that season they stay away from these plot devices and depictions of woman. the genre doesn't need it, the industry should be past these type of stories and it is so much more than that.all of that being said the series is definitely worth the wait, definitely worth watching. my personal favorites (in order) are:zima blue\\nsuits\\nsucker of souls\\nalternate histories\\nhelping hand\\nblind spot\\nshape shifters\",\"volume (i):- rating - 7.5\\u002f10\\nmost favorites- e02 (three robots), e04 (suits)\\nleast favorites- e06 (yogurt), e09 (the dump)if i were, to sum up, it is like an assemblage of distinctive storytelling, kind of an amalgamation of talented animators from all around the world. the spectrum here varies from simple 2d sketches to photo-realistic simulations; quite an ambitious endeavor, if you ask me. there are 18 episodes in total, with each of them having its own set of eccentricities and unique flavor. while i must say, some of them had struggled quite a bit to put forth their notions, others were triumphant in grabbing my curiosity.volume (ii):- rating - 8\\u002f10\\nmost favorites-\\ne03 (pop squad), e08 (the drowned giant)\\nleast favorites-\\ne02 (ice), e04 (snow in the desert)more or less the same impression, even though the makers this time have put their emphasis on quality rather than quantity as can be observed by the substantial drop in episode numbers. however, on a collective level, the narratives are more mature, have more meaning, and most importantly the production has been top-notch. half the time i was having difficulties distinguishing the virtual space from reality. everything looked so life-like.volume (iii):- rating - 9\\u002f10\\nmost favorites- e02 (bad travelling), e09 (jibaro)\\nleast favorites- e06 (swarm), e08 (entombed)this is by far the most balanced and superiorly well-rounded season. the primary reason is its innate incorporation of different subject matters as well as distinctive styles of animations with each one of them depicting various sets of sentiments and subtexts. a complete package!\",\"this is my first review ever.. and i want to try to describe this..but and from every angle i look and i always come up with one word ...\\\"madness\\\" tish is a

lower than 120hz and put a limiter on to hear any of the dialogue, what were you people thinking?\",\"i love this series! couldn't get enough of it! its so different from anything else! cant wait for season 2!\",\"at the time of reviewing, this show has had 3 seasons. season 1 was an amazing introduction to an amazing show. it had 18 anthological episodes, and not one of them i'd consider to be bad. actually, no episode in this show is bad, shockingly. many people say season 2 was disappointment, but it was just an awkward introduction to the new season lengths. it got a very bad hand in general, even though a lot of the episodes it contained were great. but season 3, wow, what an amazing season. so many all time classics, it's insane. please watch this show, you won't regret. the diversity of styles and stories alone should convince you to watch it, let alone episodes like \\\"zima blue\\\", \\\"pop squad\\\" and \\\"bad travelling,\\\" which are amazing just on their own. 10\\u002f10.\",\"brilliant series. explores so many concepts, love how every episode has its own moral or lesson. and there are so many brilliant actors. best uk show in years :)\",\"this anthology is so unique and an animation masterpiece!! i can't say enough about how great this. you need to experience it yourself.\",\"haven't watched anything original like this for a while, every episode has its own charm and atmosphere, complementing with unique storylines. things like this must be considered as piece of art! highly recommend to check it out.\",\"had watched the first season a month before , 2years after the 1st season released . was too late but had already regretted of not watching it earlier . today i had finished the 2nd season and i have no words to say , could have had more episodes tho . nevertheless this show never fails to impress me and it is definitely a must watch .\",\"despite the interesting nature of this unique series, i cannot deny the despair disappointment and fear that i feel after watching each episode. for this reason i will characterize it by the word \\\"impressive\\\".this show depicts a bitter, dark and scary picture of near future or even the present time.it shows the dark and cruel aspect of over growing technology, media and globalizing social (virtual)media as it expands its shadow and run it's roots under the skin of our souls.aside from the strong acting, what adds to the brilliance of the stories, is keeping the audience excited and enthusiastic up to the very last few minutes of the each episode, before the real story unravels.\",\"i dont get what all the fuss is about, while the cgi is good (like all movies nowadays), this series is just social engineering. i watched the first 2 episodes and it was enough to put me off, the first was pushing lgbt\\u002ffeminist garbage with cheap lesbian sex scenes, and the second was about 3 really dumb robots who were wandering the earth which was destroyed by global warming, im sorry, 'climate change', or whatever they are calling it now. all their dialogue was very weak and just cringe worthy. it would make more sense if they were from another planet, seeing how exceptionally stupid and ignorant they were.i think the problem is that there is nothing else on netflix, hence this looks like a gem amid a sea of dreary programming. anyone remember the animatrix? it just feels like love, death and robots is a big ripoff in terms of the styling, gore, sex and story telling. this programming really is for the netflix zombie hordes who dont know any better.\",\"the anthology veers sharply between gratuitous semi porn violence as sexual metaphore to almost laugh out loud sillyness with a nod to philosophy in between. you can see the homage (almost rip off) storylines everywhere. whilst i do like the style (mostly) this is effectively the visual equivalent of a smash and grab raid.\\noh and by the way never ever give cats opposable thumbs.\",\"great adult animation. the stories and art styles are varied throughout the series. some stories were better than others, but that's just a matter of individual taste. all episodes are interesting and very well done, however. if you liked heavy metal, chances are you'll love this. can't wait for series 2.\",\"the animations in this show are beautiful. really, it's top notch. as far as the storytelling is concerned, there it fails. it tries to be cyber-punky, it tries to be horror and it even tries to be funny, but it falls short of all of those goals. if there is any societal commentary in there, i don't even want to know what it is.that being said: i just saw the first four episodes and decided to quit watching. the first one was silly. it was dark for darkness' sake. as if a fourteen year old wanted to come up with a video game and hatched a blandly violent one while throwing in a blandly flat extract of lisbeth salander in there. yuck.the second one was just flat. it wasn't funny enough to be funny, it was a bit trite, and the twist device at the end was ham-fisted at best. i can't even come up with more than two lines about that one.this leads to the third one. similar story outline: stuff happens, we throw in some nudity and violence and the twist at the end is a deus ex machina that doesn't explain the circular story at all.the fourth episode is a typical american piece of mythology where hardworking white folks are colonizing the wild west, surrounded by savages that need killing. it features a completely senseless amount of violence against an indigenous species with no backstory whatsoever. it's more stupid than starship troopers was, and that's saying a lot.to cut a long story short, this is what you get when you take science fiction, strip it of its philosophical inquiries, boil it down to a 15 minute sound bite and dumb it down to serve adolescents.the two stars? well, they sure can render breasts and gore very well. i'd steer clear of this mess and go and watch some star trek, doctor who or orville, really.if you just want to see animated nudity, there's a whole genre out there that does that better too.\",\"an animated collection reminiscent of liquid television that aired on mtv in the early 1990s, ldrobots also feels similar to the anthology, \\\"spirited: 13 haunting tales,\\\" by leap books. the subject matter goes beyond what anybody could expect from standard television programming, and it examines a variety of themes from horror to science fiction to the paranormal.there is some humor, albeit off color, as in \\\"alternate histories,\\\" a look at adolph hitler's death under a variety of divergent circumstances. as unlikely as a squid landing on the moon, the animated short blasts a cascade of ideas for the viewer to consider in a fashion very similar to ldrobots as a whole. individually, the animated shorts manage to hit the screen, one after another, feeling original in scope and context to the point of being outlandish.many segments feel like treatments for feature-length films. the volume and quality of actors lending their talents to the works demonstrate how serious an undertaking the originators were as blueprints for the project were being drawn. especially in \\\"sonnie's edge,\\\" blending the vocal talent of relative newcomer hayley mclaughlin (deadly switch, netflix) with the experience of time winters (metal gear solid v, sneakers) and many others to craft a story of fantasy-combat that could succeed as a graphic novel, video game or animated film. there are so many layers to the epic story, it's 17-minute runtime just scratches the surface.if ldrobots has a flaw, it's brevity. almost every short left me grimacing at the abbreviated length. as of this writing in early 2020, netflix hints that another volume is coming. it helps a bit, leaving me to watch \\\"the secret war,\\\" an almost 17-minute whirlwind of red army soldiers engaged in one-quarters combat with croaking demons in siberia. the story cuts me off like a dealer holding out on a junkie just when the action is at fever pitch. the screen goes black and i want to fling the remote in anger. i just wanted a little more.\",\"each and every episode brings something different to the series. it's captivating, entertaining, haunting... i feel like the first and third seasons are better, they both have something extra to them. second season got a little \\\"over worked\\\", if that makes sense..\\ni love this show!!\",\"some episodes are good ... some are bad. some episodes will make you want to turn back in time because you've wasted an hour watching a boring one.however , the episodes that are good are cleverly thought out and really does scare you because of the reality of the situations.\",\"first of all kudos to the creators to make this beautiful series. every single episode is full of entertainment, humor and awesomeness. i wish there were more of them but will wait for the next season.dont think about it, just start watching and you will enter the awesomeness created by netflix.\",\"all the animations are put together well. the stories are individual and unique, leaving you wanting more.the only problem is most of the stories are objectifying women... lots of scenes of naked females and potential rape, sometimes glorifying it, which is disappointing and unnecessary.the stories themselves are original, and could have been more.an interesting move by netflix, but as stated, women in a larger majority of the shorts, do not need to be objectified.women watch and enjoy animation too.make sure the next series has more equality for women, portraying us more than just objects of sexual immature male fantasies.grow up guys!!\",\"spectacular audio and animation violent,sad,funny good stories.netflix did a good job,did something that most people do not expept to see.i want more content like that please netflix.\",\"i've been waiting for something like this for so long. compelling and well done short stories. can't wait for season two!!\",\"it's unfair to compare this series to the twilight zone. unfortunately, that's the only comparison available. additionally,with such a variety of writers and directors, the range of styles and methods of execution make it a collage. the common threads are the producer, a dystopian view and british film\\u002ftv movie making sensibility.many episodes could stand on their own as full theatrical releases. a few need not have been made. taken in its entirety, the body of work is genius. it will likely remain viable for generations as the technologies foreseen will be compared to the similar technologies that will become reality. where series such as star trek and star wars futurist views are defined by the movie making technology of the time, this series is defined by the creative talent and imagination of the production staff. like i said, british. fortunately, this wasn't (or has not yet) been f'd up by hollywood.reading some of the reviews are, as other non us series of movies, not fully appreciated by the us audience. it lacks the typical banality and requires an intellect or education level beyond the us electorate to fully appreciate the work.clue, there's no laugh track or formula or predicable outcome. sorry trump supporters, this one requires a brain.\",\"well...every where we see movies with love,action, comedy, sci-fi, but netflix be like okay make some badass bloody,dark,humour, confusing , horror type movies but not with real people buy animated people....not so long story but episode type story...and boooooom here you go... behold the awesomeness....just watch and enjoy....\",\"three things make this series a completely amazing series.story: very good story story telling. we get a glimpse on the life of various characters. most of them being inspired by sci-fi writers. they have done a great job adapting the medium of storytelling to one that fitted the story best.animation: this medium has allowed the liberties needed to bring some projects to life. the insane realism of some of the stores made difficult to even imagine how some of the shots where made.no pg constraints: it feels that the current trend of catering to most of the population outright kills most of the projects that want to explore that side of story-telling. it didn't feel in your face about it at all. the reality is that blood, nudity and sex are very natural things and trying to completely eradicate them from tv is very sad.\",\"some of the stories were complete and fantastic. some left you wanting to know why they were made.i thought nudity was unnecessarily present. the audience could have been vastly expanded and more encapsulated with the plot if there was less casual nudity.\",\"i dont wanna compare which one was the best but i felt every episode was the best in its's own way . more eerie creepy some smiles and a sense of what will happen will there be a continuation will make you to watch the next episode expecting the same.. the animations are all well done nothing subpar and deserves all a big thumbs up.\",\"love, death & robots is the new original netflix animated series. the first time i heard this show was being produced, i was reading some news, when i suddenly saw the headline of this new animated show from netflix, produced by david fincher and tim miller. that caught my eye, obviously.after watching the trailer, i was all in. it looked fresh and unique. after watching the series i can confirm. it's both of those things. the series is very experimental, different episodes, different styles. each style of animation is unique in it's own way.the series is episodic. it's not a linear story told through multiple episodes. which is good because a series like this becomes a playground for all the directors. now, you may think that this is good. and you're right, it is. when it works.some directors are concerned in telling a story, others are concerned in experimenting. an example of this is: zima blue, one of the best episodes, because it's really telling a story about deconstruction, literally and figuratively, while using it's beautiful style of animation to emphasise the artistic nature of the character. on the other hand, the episode, alternate stories, is about different ways of killing hitler. yes, you just read that. it is as simple as it looks. which makes the episode silly, becoming repetitive very fast.love, death & robots is good. yes, it is experimental. some episodes are more inventive than others. but, i have to commend netflix for it, even though it has those issues. watching the episodes are to say the least, fun. one of the best series netflix produced in quite some time.\",\"season 3 is my favorite. all the episodes in session 3 was great. but in all other seasons , few episodes we're good , few we're bad. it's worth giving a try, if you are a technology, innovation lover. few episodes we're absolutely brilliant.\",\"i wish netflix made more quality originals as this one.\\ngreat, original, & creative\",\"hard hitting! this is the perfect example of the future of humanity. every episode is superb. i want to salute the writers of this series. my favorite season is season 3 (nosedive, hated by nation, and men against fire).\",\"i must say i am an avid netflix viewer. and i enjoy alot of there shows. i stumbled upon love death + robots randomly. right off the bat i was hooked! the first episode made me want more of the story to only go to the next episode and find out that they are all there own different story's. i was in shock at how great the graphics were and how well the story lines were and that i havent heard anything about it yet.5 min into the first episode i realized they were going to go hard core extremely graphic killing and yes even extreme nudity! the 3rd episode (i believe) there was a women dancing naked and you pretty much see everything, and i mean down there everything.it was just great tho to see the way they told the story using these methods and ahowing thw kind of worlds these people lived in.it was very animatrix meets japanimation if you have seen any of those. along with the story linea and story telling of black mirror. thats the beat description i can give. its a perfect mix of all those things.\",\"i never expected this kind of a brilliant work in the form of a series. especially, the white christmas special episode, so far the best of all. this series shows how technology can be used to help a man or make his life miserable. though it contains some dystopian view, it surely is a warning to people who thinks technology as their salvation.\\nwhoever's behind the scripts are geniuses.\",\"most of the episodes are nearly brilliant. in both manners, animation and storytelling. the short movies manage to tell great stories and even develop great characters. can't hardly wait for new episodes and freakish ideas.\",\"love, death & robots 2 is thematically and stylistically repetitive. half of this much shorter season is animated in an ultra realistic style where the visuals mesh so well they could jump episodes easily. given enough money to cover special effects you might as well have used living actors for all animation brought to the table. even the ones that were more stylized brought nothing you hadn't already seen in season 1. now don't get me wrong, the animation standards were high, but you've seen it all before and many times at that.thematically it is the same bag (with the only exceptions being \\\"the tall grass\\\", \\\"all through the house\\\", and \\\"the drowned giant\\\"); dystopian future, heavy on future tech, resources scarce, mankind's fault.two stories are identical in which the house robot goes haywire and tries to kill the occupant. two others have a man buck the oppressive system and pay for it.otherwise, \\\"ttg\\\" featured an idiot idiot-ing into a danger telegraphed a mile away to the viewer. \\\"atth\\\" was kind of cute and although it's twist was also telegraphed it did leave you with a little to think about when it comes to expectations. \\\"tdg\\\" is straight out of the classic \\\"gulliver's travels\\\" story, lilliputians and all but alas, this giant did not have luck on his side. of all the episodes this provided the most food for thought, being on the nature of how an event goes from the facts, to society's and an individual's interpretation of those facts, and ultimately to legend and how little bearing that legend might have to the original event.it would have been hard to top season 1 to be honest but this doesn't even come close. season 1 was a 10; even the ones i didn't care for had interesting animation styles and stories that were not cliche. i have watched many of those several times but there are none in season 2 i care to watch again. the overwhelmingly dark and depressing tone of 2 doesn't help either. this is such a disappointment.i am very disappointed.\",\"if it had more episode it would beat breaking bad, walking dead ,daredevil even game of thrones .i don't know why it is not one most famous tv series ever created.features speculative fiction with dark and sometimes satirical themes that examine modern society, particularlywith regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies.it takes you to edge of dark human nature and in awkward scenario in which people may exhibit so extreme behavior.its a must watch if you liked got, bb ,twd ,daredevil like me ... you will love it like me .a different stuff that rest of them all combined . each episode with a new theme . no connection between episodes.\",\"set aside the stories, this series has the best animation and different variations of it. the visual effects of some episodes is absolutely jaw dropping whereas some other episodes nah!!! narratively weak.\",\"i enjoyed this series a lot. the animation is fantastic, the stories interesting and i'm a sucker for sci fi so it ticked a load of boxes for me.for the most part it's an enjoyable experiment that reminded me of reading my dad's old 70's short story collections. when one story underwhelms you it doesn't matter because its short and there's another one coming up.the issues i have with it are something sci fi has struggled with forever. the characters come across as if they're written by a teenage boy. they're all tough and fight regardless of the consequences, they use swear words, they're just so cool! only the issue is they're not. they're outdated clichés and i'm bored silly if them.also most female characters seem to exist as tools to men or convenient breasts. granted the helping hand story didn't do that (one of the stronger episodes) but she was tough and swore a lot.to summarize this is great stuff. talented animators create interesting worlds (good huntings hong kong was great) that grip me to the screen wondering what the next one will be. its just let down a little bit by its sometimes weak cliche characters.sci fi can really prosper in animated form and i look forward to another series.\",\"just amazing. the show is beautiful and each of the stories stand on their own two feet. really well done and i hope there's a season two\",\"every episode is around 17 minutes long and every story is different with different genres. most are good, some are bad while a few are excellent in stories but the art in the animation is stunning. different 2d animations. kudos to the animation artists, you have done some beautiful amalgamation of everything perfect in animation.\",\"i didn't know in advance, that this show presents a single animated movie which goes for like 10 minutes maybe.to be honest, i liked the 1st season but remembered a great yt-channel i could recommend to everyone, as it also has some great art, great stories and great animations, its name is cgmeetup. a lot of raw talent there, at first i thought they picked some animations from there or at least those who has made content for that channel.i sadly noticed that s2 is that short :( what a bummer.but there is potential, surely. had a lot going on in season1.\",\"probably the best show ever made, at least up there, and will probably continue to get better.\",\"well worth a watch, never get boring as the various styles and plot lines keep you engaged. some better than other but i'm glad i watch the series.\",\"an anthology of short adult animated films, love, death & robots proves adept at communicating the ability of animation to visualize and portray all kinds of stories. each episode is an adaptation of a short story or novella broadly falling under one or more of the three themes that are spelled out by the series' title. realized by a consortium of animation studios, an impressive array of art and animation styles are used to bring to life the episodes' content.there is a vast variety to the stories selected in this anthology. some of the vignettes like \\\"the witness\\\", \\\"zima blue\\\", \\\"pop squad\\\", \\\"the drowned giant\\\", \\\"bad travelling\\\" and \\\"swarm\\\" are profound and thought-provoking with metaphorical interpretations or philosophical underpinnings. others such as \\\"three robots\\\", \\\"alternate histories\\\" and \\\"night of the mini dead\\\" are light-hearted or humorous. episodes like \\\"sonnie's edge\\\", \\\"the secret war\\\", \\\"snow in the desert\\\" and \\\"in vaulted halls entombed\\\" are examples of visually-captivating worldbuilding. reimagined folk tales and local legends get their share of the spotlight through \\\"sucker of souls\\\", \\\"good hunting\\\", \\\"all through the house\\\" and \\\"jibaro\\\". space settings are notably present in \\\"beyond the aquila rift\\\", \\\"helping hand\\\", \\\"life hutch\\\" and \\\"the very pulse of the machine\\\" with \\\"suits\\\", \\\"automated customer service\\\" and \\\"mason's rats\\\" showcasing mechs and robotics, for good or bad. there are more episodes, but this should suffice to convey the range and diverse nature of the content on offer.i do feel that as of yet, even if there is a lot of adult imagery and mature narratives, the theme of love hasn't been explored very deeply. there are also dips and troughs in the quality, particularly with season 2 as a whole being less compelling than season 1, perhaps due to a reduced number of episodes. season 3 is better than its predecessor but the stories still feel a little lacking.but nonetheless, love, death & robots is a must-watch for any lover of animation. each episode is a unique experience with its own blend of artistry and storytelling that will more often than not enamour and entertain its audience.\",\"totally weird. each episode runs for an average 15 mins, each one more freakier than the other.but help me, i really enjoyed most of them. it's like tim miller saying \\\"i don't care whether you like it or not. i will anyways make whatever i think. if you don't like it, it's not your cup of tea\\\".and the product came out surprisingly unique and dramatic. the animations are top notch, the imaginations are singular, the plots are bold.will wait for more!\",\"season one is what happens when you give resources to talented people and let them do their thing. amazing through and through.season two on the other hand is what happens when you mute the same people and make them work for half the wage. there is only 1 story that stands out and this season is mot even as half as long as the last one. why netflix would let this is beyond me, as the first season was an immense success story.it's worth watching, the animations are amazing nonetheless, it's just a shame that netflix lets such good shows rot while churning out digested dog food.\",\"i knew nothing going into the show, and it completely blew me away. when i started watching, i got a very familiar 'animatrix'-vibe from it, and i enjoyed the ride of the first episode so much, that i binge watched the entire season the same day. fantastic art styles, animation and great storytelling. some episodes stood stronger than others of course, but i enjoyed every second and i hope i get a chance to see more.\\none of the most entertaining experiences i've had on netflix for a while! 10\\u002f10\",\"it is more like a bunch of movies brought together by the same theme: technology. every eposode is different and special in its own way. loved

can downright hate an episode and still not have to devote an entire afternoon to the droll experience.i feel like this format suits me very well since i don't like to have things too drawn out. i like patient story telling but don't need padded run times.fresh and inventive.good on you nf.\",\"this series feels so relevant to our current world and has actually made me want to shun social media and modern technology. cultures and settings are interchangeable and there is never any indication of where it's shot or whether it's set in the future or modern day, which only adds to the other worldliness of the series. charlie brooker himself has said that the title is based on an idea that when we look into a black (switched off) computer screen it reflects a dark shadow back to us. this shadow form accurately reflects the darker recesses of the human mind as depicted by the show's protagonists. episodes vary dramatically however this theme is always beautifully maintained throughout. the writing is so intelligent and thought-provoking to the point where the message stays with you long after viewing. very few series make me feel fully immersed in the storytelling like this one does and i'm already itching for the next season. intelligent writing, beautifully executed.\",\"i love thats its always something new in every episode. makes me think about the future and the different paths that us as people and science can go which i love. and i hope to see more seasons to come!!\",\"ate it all raw. best animated series on netflix or anywhere ever!\",\"if netflix would excist merely with content like this and nothing else, i would pay even more every month and smile every time i do so. bravo!\",\"each and every episode is different than the last and better. the episodes are short stories depicted with the help of animation and graphics.almost every episode has a gripping tale to tell and the animation is just too good. unlike anything i have seen before.\",\"the first 3 seasons were amazing , not able to find the right word to explain it . and waiting very impatiently , i am now on 4th episode but still waiting for the past seasons effects . hv not able to find it yet , but i am such hopefull about it , because it is still one of my favourite series\",\"this season continues the move away from the sci-fi themed story telling. now it's all about how many stars they can sicophantically attach to an episode, or counter balance with a contrived unknown. the stories are just awful, dull, lifeless, almost sporadic in their dullness. it started a few seasons ago, with the famous mullet child \\\"singer\\\" and a story about a doll (?), and it's continued descending down, until quite literally it has managed to attract a devil from the lowest pits of hell. death and robots has cruised past this roadwreck, and it wouldn't have wrecked if they had just left it as it was at season 3. but they obviously just wanted to suck more cash out of its bloated puffy face, and let's face it, use it as a chance to meet their favorite celebs. this show is now like a pompous art exhibition, with talentles \\\"celebs\\\" drifting around, waiting for their own episode, and no doubt being told repeatedly about how amazing they are, and how amazing this episode will be blah blah blah. in reality each season of this has mirrored charlie brookers writing talent, and now they are both, just all so passe.\",\"this is nothing short of excellent. it is intelligent above all, and i think that is the most attractive feature. the concepts addressed in this show are deep and meaningful; the sort of things we should all take time to contemplate in our daily lives. i especially love that each episode is a different story exploring a different scenario - its refreshing and engaging, at times making you feel as if you are experiencing everything first-hand, because the protagonist in each tale is someone we can all relate to. i really hope more and more people get to see this. a deep thank you to the creators and contributors!\",\"there are some truly great episodes in among these short stories, but there is also a lot of trash, and most of \\\"meh, but what the hell where they smoking\\\"\",\"i haven't seen an animated anthology this pristine and rich since the animatrix. if you're a lover of animated adult science fiction then you'll love this grimy, mature take on the genre. the 18 stories featured in this series were breathtaking, hilarious, moving, and unbelievably unique. if you're 18 or older and looking for something new and fresh to watch... love, death & robots should be moved to the top of your watchlist.\",\"i could watch each episode over and over again. it is futuristic, but accurate and that is the scariest part about the series. my favourite one is probably nosedive.\",\"at first i didn't know what i was hoping for but boy oh boy. once i started i couldn't stop my self. stories are short around 10-15 minutes but every single episode is so intriguing so creative that at the end of each episode you want to tell all your friends how awesome this is..\\nwhoever came up with the stories... really hats off to the guy. really amazing series.\\nhope there'll be a second season of this.\",\"\\\"love, death & robots\\\" is an interesting show, it's filled with a collection of short episodes that have unique stories. each episodes the characters and their stories change, but the animation is flawless. the textures look realistic and how they interact with the environment is lovely, the sound design is amazing too. but again, the animation, whilst watching the show i never noticed a dip in quality, each episode is filled with so much detail that keeps you engaged and that's how you get hooked. the voice actors have done an amazing job too at bringing these characters to life and giving the story more depth.\",\"just watch season 1, the 2nd season has maybe 2 episodes that are worth watching namely \\\"snow\\\" and can't even remember the 2nd one.\",\"especially volume 3, episode \\\"three robots: exit strategies\\\"\\nyou cant hit the human nail in the head better than this. absolutely fantastic.the whole series is great watching, and i love it, some shows not for all, but that is for you to judge.great series, watch it!\",\"every once in a while, i come across a show that i can't stop talking about, and this is my new show! i wish it was longer because there wasn't one episode i didn't love! so creative and talented. bravo to everyone who put this together. and thank you netflix for serving us this delicious piece of art.\",\"brooker has created a virtuous science fiction drama anthology. this series has outstanding direction, writing, cinematography, special effects, custome, settings, soundtrack and acting. the entire cast deliver bravura realistic performances and includes the likes of howard, hamm, plemons, kaluuya, john-kamen, atwell, flynn and many more stellar artists. the series is a tapestry of futuristic and modern-day stand alone tales that are thrilling, perplexing, crisp and full of satire. using technology as a source of paranoia, the stories explore the collective anxious state of mind of the world. each story features it's own cast of prodigious and mystifying characters. the plots for each episode are clever, unique, thought provoking, insightful, duplicitous, cathartic and have stunning endings. it's a refreshing look at how technology can turn on society when in today's world people feel like they're missing out on or aren't part of something bigger if they're not participating in some form of social media. the series also scrutinizes technology turning on itself, humans using technology to turn on eachother and humans using technology to turn on themselves. this is a one of a kind, captivating, mesmorizing and memorable series. i look forward to viewing what the series has in store for next season.\",\"this short format allows a lot of great ideas to see the screen, that would otherwise never be made into a whole film ot tv show. there is more great writing, great visuals and engaging surprises here than a barrel full of 'normal' film fare. very very recommended entertainment, and a sincere hope this is the start of more to come, please producers...\",\"i haven't finished all of the current episodes, i'm not too far into volume 2. i just finished snow in the desert and that was when i realized why this show is so breathtaking and unique. most of the worlds where the show takes place are real, fleshed out and lived in. every episode is a clean slate so the character that you fall in love with is never safe because they could die at any moment. writers don't have to feel constrained about making a sequel or another episode so anything could happen at any moment. the episode pop squad was one of the best \\\"short stories\\\" i have ever seen. i see the show like a volume of short stories. it reminds me of the twightzone because every episode is a self contained world. sure, not all the worlds are equal and some might fall flat. i did not care for ice. but the show can dust itself off and land a masterpiece in the next episode with pop squad. i think shows like this are important because it allows artists to take huge risks. some of those risks have a huge pay off, some don't.\",\"this is definitely not everyone's cup of tea: love, death + robots could as well been named sex, violence + scifi! as a fan of the 80's and 90's heavy metal (as in the graphic magazine with sci-fi & fantasy themes) i totally loved ldr.the visuals are stunning and different in every episode. the styles varies from hyper realistic cgi à call of duty type video games to anime style to hyper realistic cartoon styles animation, and no matter in what style the episode is made in, it never feel \\\"out of touch\\\" or misplaced.like in the mentioned hm magazines, the stories are short (around 15 minutes per ep.) which is a good thing: the storytelling is tight, you never get bored with unnecessary subplots (which doesn't mean i have a short attention span, but i feel many weak subplots are forced into many movies or shows today to make them \\\"deeper\\\" and to extend a tv episode length story into a movie length story).\\nthe episodes are a good mix of different genres (though with one foot of curse heavily cemented in scifi&fantasy department): there's action (ep. 1) followed by humor (ep. 2) and then mystery (ep. 3), horror, satire, drama and so on, which means for you as viewer don't know what to expect.some reviewers have issues with the character developments which in 15 minutes episodes are undeniable very two-dimensional. i personally don't miss deeper character developments in these kind of stories: you as a viewer are thrown in midway in some unknown character's life and try to puzzle together what's happening, and then waiting to see what the plot twist will be (there's almost alway's some kind of a plot twist in the end in these kind of twilight zone\\u002fblack mirror stories, and often also quite predictive, especially if you have watched or read these kind of stories before).it feels like netflix really have given the creators freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. the show doesn't hold anything back (meaning many episodes are very nsfw, with gratuitous sex and violence, and even some erected male genitals which usually is a major no-no) and is a wonderful wacky mixture of graphic styles and stories (action, horror, humor, drama and even philosophical themes). just sit back in you chair and enjoy the ride!\",\"not even close to season 1. michael b jordan episode is just dull.\",\"really nice series a lot of different individual stories that needs to continue. i'd wish some episodes would me longer tho :)\",\"2 years for season 2 and this is what we got? 8 short episodes full of cr*p.dont bother with seas.3.\",\"the first thing to note is that much like the previous season, this one felt a bit too short. while the first season had sixteen episodes, this season only had nine. since the episodes' running time ranges anywhere from six to twenty minutes, watching season 3 can sadly feel like a fleeting experience if you were binging it. it is still long enough to scratch the itch that a year's hiatus left by the last season, but leaves the viewer wanting more.however, what season 3 lacks in quantity, it more than makes up in quality. with a couple of exceptions - night of the mini dead is literally a zombie movie on fast forward - the season is absolutely fantastic. whether it is a welcome return to the show's original season in three robots: exit strategies or a weapon of mass destruction with the personality of a puppy in the episode kill team kill, fans of the show will undoubtedly find something to enjoy.\",\"love, death, philosophy, biochemistry and mechanics. this is a series which, i will never want it to finish. i'm actually very sad that i reached the final episode. i was watching with all my senses, laterally. i even played-back some scenes on work to just figure out if i'm understand right or not. highly recommended. please give us more seasons.\",\"this show will blow you away. the story telling, the animation style, design, music....its like nothing else i've see. you must see it.\",\"for the most part i like these shorts a lot; they have great stories, some that could make cool movies. my disappointment was with the insane amount of nudity and sexuality in them. most of these stories could have been told without the need to make most of the women lesbians and everyone getting naked.\",\"i can't imagine anyone over 16 watching the entire season and giving it more than a 6. no love (lot of sex though \\u002f borderline porn). death is here in form of carnage and mutilation. a few robots and a lot of already seen monsters. should be called sex, carnage and a few robots. very disappointed with the direction entertainment is going.\",\"i loved the animation style of many of the episodes in this series. some of the stories were interesting. some strange and seemingly pointless like the witness. i loved the good hunting episode. i also appreciated the elements of hypersexuality and over the top violence, which we just don't get enough of in current mainstream media. thank you netflix.\",\"first of all my rating of 8 is only for season 1 i fell like it losing quality over the seasons.we all love \\\"love death and robots\\\" because it's a wonder of storytelling, a complete coherent story in 10, 15 minutes it's just impossible but they did it and my favorite story is of course zima blue i've never seen anything like it just genius imagine telling this story to someone being high 😂😂just crazy. so yeah my favorite season was the first and the last one season 3 is the worst lack of coherence and incomplete stories for the most part but it's still something to watch!\",\"in the last couple of days, everybody around me were talking about this series thus i decided to start watching it. when i watched the first episode, i was impressed enough. first of all the way they summarize the topic is unique unprecedentedly. in each episodes, it has a different team different actors and actresses also different stories but all episodes has a common point which is criticisms of modern society and its challenges. we all can see modern technology became our new friend that is ruining our life in every second of every day.this is more than a tv series, this is giving us a way to think with a critical approach. thanks for giving me a different point of view.\",\"\\\"a collection of sci fi animated shorts mostly pertaining something to do with love, death, or robots. as someone who tends to gravitate towards preferring the longer, slower series format over that of films, shorts are an art at yet the further end of that spectrum. to have only 10 - 15 minutes to set up, build, and walk through a narrative is extremely difficult and i believe is why we tend to see shorts in the realm of \\\"\\\"people at the bus stop\\\"\\\" stories, since the setting is common ground and let's us immediately dive into the intricacies of the story, the sparkles that make it shine. all of this is to say that when we move to the sci-fi setting 15 minute shorts end up taking the large portion of their time in the \\\"\\\"set-up\\\"\\\" phase, with the payoff being a cool blip 30 seconds from the end. ld&r often plays exactly into this, leaving me with a \\\"\\\"oh okay i guess\\\"\\\" sort of feeling after many shorts ended. a few of the plots \\u002f twists were cool, but even less than a week later, few are memorable. if you're a fan of animation alone then this series should be definitely on your list, it has all the goodies: cel, motion capture, 3d, and my favourite rotoscoping, but as sci fi narratives its a little flat.volume 3 of this animated sci-fi shorts anthology was just released so wanted to check it out. like those before there are some of these that shine, others that aren't so great. each is relatively quick, all generally shorter than 20 minutes. as consistent as those volumes before in quality, from this series episodes night of the mini dead and the finale jibaro were my personal favourites. if you like animation, definitely would recommend.\\\"\",\"i am completely blown away by the quality of the animation in this series. some of the hyper-realistic episodes make you wonder if you are looking at animation or video of live actors.in season 2 i was especially taken with \\\"all through the house\\\" and \\\"the drowned giant\\\" - episodes that stirred my imagination and challenged my perceptions.\",\"it's one of those shows that you can't stop watching bc your mind is going to be wrecked and intrigued with every episode. the casting is amazing no matter what side of the pond you are on.\",\"the stories are unique each episode, the animation alternates, and the episodes are short and fast paced. i found the content different and enjoyable. there isn't much adult content like this on netflix, but i hope they add more.\",\"this show is one of the best i've seen lately. it makes you think about arguable topics, and whether we should continue the technological developing trend or not. i also like the depressive settings which contributed to your involvement in this show. after episode 1 i could not stop watching anymore because it really intrigues me. however, not all episodes do play on your feelings the same. some are much more personal than others, however, overall it did a great job and makes one really think about it.all by all, i think each episode (i watched until now) was a masterpiece by itself and made me eager for more. the show also includes many innovative ideas which i think are also very interesting.\",\"s2 was boring and short. i was thinking s2 would be perfect but very disappointing.\",\"there are many extremely entertaining episodes. definitely the opposite of typical shows. you never know what you're going to get. good for watching alone, but i decided to write a review after watching a particularly terrible episode.the storyline i just last watched was trash and it seemed like it was an excuse for an artist to be as gory as possible at the expense of everything else. i ended up fast-forwarding through even after increasing the play speed.i only gave 6\\u002f10 stars because many episodes are unsharable based on graphic content. even if the story and originality is great, not being able to share it destroys the biggest enjoyment for me personally.\",\"there is no meaning behind most of stories. just some lucky fancy guys in future who fight\\u002frun. nay i'm not gonna watch again. netflix need to keep up its quality, instead of landslides after the first season.\",\"the frightening truths behind technology in a not so far future, in my opinion. you can definitely see there are briliant minds behind this show and it got better and better with each episode. some were unbearable to watch for a person like me who fells the movie, if you know what i mean. but yet, perfect! disturbing and intriguing in the same time. a great balance between horror, science fiction and misters. such a pleasure to watch them all! please make more of it!🙏\",\"i love it, every episodes are unique and differents!\",\"as with all anthologies, the episodes are hit and miss. mostly, the graphics are enthralling. some of the stories are entertaining, and some are gross, as in \\\"what were they thinking?\\\"the producers needed to find competent audio mixers. some of the episodes have dialog at 20 dbm while the special effects are at 90 dbm. clearly, this does not make a pleasant viewing experience.the anthology is heavy on swarms of creatures. after three volumes, the swarm episodes got a little tired.i am surpised that \\\"zima blue\\\" is rated so highly. i found it to be an extremely boring paean to black supremacy. probably the most gross is \\\"the drowned giant.\\\"\",\"being a big sci-fi fan and gamer, this is totally something else. words can't explain how much i loved it. tim miller take bow fantastically directed, the whole team who came up with these theories and make it visually spectacular for us to watch i bow down to you. one of the best things i've seen in my life.\",\"thank you netflix!!! thank you very much! i enjoyed every second of this masterpiece!! every episode was incredible, congrats to the whole team, one of the best shows i have ever seen\",\"second season felt worse than the first, with only 3 enjoyable episodes out of 8 (well, the snow one started well but felt unfinished, like it was just a teaser, but the last 2 were well-rounded and actually good in their own ways). the rest was just worthless dark&dystopian nonsense or comedy-horror nonsense animation. have to take it down a notch from 8\\u002f10.s3: they brought it back to 5 good episodes out of 8, so 8\\u002f10 again from me.\",\"series with episodes all disconnected really beautiful and very original, each episode has a different plot and they are all however connected by the title that requires it to be a story with a more or less common theme.\",\"this show puts a spin on modern and futuristic (not so distant future too) technology and how it is impacting our culture as a whole. how we as a people view it and each other as a result of our attachment to that technology. it makes you turn back on yourself and say \\\"i could really see that happening someday\\\" in some and \\\"oh man, i do that all the time!\\\" in others. kind of reminds me of how the outer limits was done back in the 90's just re-imagined for today's viewer, there is some message to be understood from each one. each episode is completely different than the last, constantly keeping you on your toes while still keeping things fresh and new. my only request is that they get some more funding so we can start getting longer seasons!\",\"season 1 was just great. really fresh and original, with some very memorable and clever stories.season 2 was largely a write-off. i did like all through the house and the wistful state-of-things commentary of the drowned giant. also ice was beautiful to watch. but the insultingly bad pop squad nearly ruined the whole experience.i highly recommend watch season 1, it's great. treat season 2 as an also-ran, a time-filler merely for completeness' sake.sadly, i think season 2 indicates netflix have lost interest and there probably won't be a season 3 collection - or it will be as brief, dull and stupid as season 2.\",\"while watching, i had this overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and deja vu. then i realized i was having that because this series is like a modern day, nsfw, ray bradbury short story compilation. a little bit of horror, a lot of sci-fi and a sprinkle of wtf thrown in for good measure. i am completely in love with this series and i hope they do many more seasons.\",\"i love anthologies, and i love animation... so the two together is a real treat. especially when the animation and story lines are so brilliant and emotional. watch this show, you won't regret a second!\",\"this is an entertaining series that is likely no running. like many others, the quality of the seasons and its episodes vary quite a bit. season 3 was pretty weak, with a few episodes that either made no sense or were totally incomprehensible. the cast is usually solid but the storylines seem to be very inconsistent in quality. some are really clever, others just plain silly. fortunately, for the binge watcher, they can easily skip through the rubbish episodes, and also fast forward through the long drawn out bits that offer little relevance to the main theme. after a while, the episodes tend to become less clever and entertaining. it cannot be easy to maintain momentum for series like this. pick the episodes you like and make do with those! not every episode works!\",\"every 6 months or so i feel the need to browse through these episodes and randomy watch.\\nevery story is a visual and poetic master piece weather you are into sci-fi, anime or not. it takes you to different universes at each episode and it only gets better. enjoy the ride. no more words can justify what it is.netflix should keep this alive.\",\"love, death & robots is an adult animated anthology television series that airs on netflix. it has a collection of animated short stories consisting of various different genres in each episode.season 1:\\nin its first season, love, death & robot has 18 episodes that are unique, wild, dangerous, full of action, suspense, horror, full of bloody scenes, crazy and of course amazing. the story in each episode is different seasoned with amazing visual effects. if we pay attention, the visuals displayed use different animations, ranging from computer visuals to animations from cgi effects that almost look real. the first season of love, death & robots that did not disappoint. various scenes do appear vulgarly, boldly and present a different atmosphere. a unique story with great conflict and meaning. this first season presents its own sensation and experience in enjoying this series. one of the best episodes for me was zima blue.season 2:\\nthe second season ran with 8 episodes. still with the same concept as the first season, from the visuals to the story. for me, this second season has a deep meaning for understanding human nature. might want to elevate and explore the underside and character of the human being. some episodes have the meaning of life with shades of the human ego. as in the episode pop squad which looks at humans who have developed on their thinking. also in the episode automated customer service which shows that how bad and lazy humans are when they have experienced a period of technological sophistication.season 3:\\nthe third season which ran with 9 episodes. for this time, many episodes present scenes with bloodshed or bring out actions full of cruelty, brutality to bleed. this third season is a bit of a stretch for me compared to the previous two seasons. dark impressions can also be felt in this series. however, it does not close that this season is still fairly good. it has a new and fresh story, prioritizing fast-paced actions like in the episode kill team kill. this third season is still with good visuals. stories and conflicts can indeed be said to be full of bloodshed.\",\"this show really captures where we are currently heading as a society! it is the most perfect \\\"use caution with tech\\\" tale i could imagine!\",\"the thing i love about netflix is that they are willing to take risks on productions like this. this show ended up being an amazing series that presents many concepts. not all the episodes are all too good, but some of the episodes really are breathtaking.\",\"\\\"love, death & robots\\\" is both everything a series should strive to be, and many things it shouldn't. you get the sense that if the runtime of several episodes extended to even just 20 minutes, instead of 15 or sometimes 10, it could become one of the greatest shows of the last decade. the recent program \\\"over the garden wall\\\" shared the same weakness. that show was a near-masterpiece, with a real sense of enchantment that is utterly lost in entertainment today. if each episode were but a few minutes longer there could have been a feeling of finality given to some of the stories. this show is the same way, with episodes like \\\"fish night\\\" and \\\"alternate histories\\\" as prime examples. the ideas themselves are inspired, beautifully captured on-screen and unique to themselves but often feel cut short. however, it's a credit to the series that the majority of episodes feel as ruminative and imaginative as they do with the little time they occupy. close to be being a revelation, just not quite there. but an impressive and captivating work of art.\",\"i really liked the season 1, it's like black mirror without boundaries. how spooky future and others universes could be. the season 2 isn't such impressive like the 1, but still it is good. i'm already waiting for season 3.\",\"after now watching the second season of love, death & robots, i can say i feel similarly underwhelmed. every episode of this show has beautiful animation and style (although i prefer the stylized episodes much more than the one aiming for a photorealistic look), but stories in this show either offer very little or, because of the episode runtime of about 10 to 15 minutes, have little time to explore these stories effectively (\\\"\\\"pop squad\\\" from season 2 could have really used more time to flesh out it's world\\\").i begin every episode of this show with a \\\"my god, this is gorgeous\\\" and end it with a \\\"wait, this is it?\\\"\",\"when i heard of the series and david fincher on it i thought it sounded a bit like when, back in the 80's, spielberg directed \\\"amazing stories\\\" (good director + fantasy + on tv)...but not remotely.\\neven though the technical side of it all is surely \\\"topnoch\\\", the stories are mainly poor and repetitive: gratuitous violence and \\\"dejà vú\\\" aliens or fantasy creatures, all seasoned with some nudity here and there. it all has a flair of videogame animation that its certainly boring (apart from 3 or 4 episodes) and does not make any aproach to a more creative, crafty or contemporary animation or narrative which interpellates viewers to think and open their minds (and have fun doing so). i dont get how this is supposed to be meant for adult audiences with such lame scripts, really: military werewolves in middle east?! (this particular one is embarassing..) robot monster fights?! (pokemon for adults i guess...) farmers fighting aliens?! (starship troopers 2019)...creativity in pure state of downfall...\\ngreat creators, animators, illustrators and storytellers are all around the web with more sensibilty, magic and a new approach to visual narrative and much better stories to tell and inspire (and make audiences think a bit or feel o fly with their imagination...)...please look for them and hire!\\na missed opportunity to give indie animation a space in a mainstream platform. too bad.\",\"brilliant scripts and screenplays. it packs all the jitters of a thriller and gloom of the dark side of technology.\",\"sci-fi which high

bandersnatch\",\"there are definitely weaker episodes, some just not utilising animation, nor story, in an artistic and interesting way, especially paling, when compared directly to the other gems in this series.some of these films are just phenomenal, on a story level, having good characters, and character dinamics, while telling and interesting story, though the type varies drastically from episode to episode, other films shining mainly, yet not exclusively, in their way of showing us what animation and an artist vision can achieve; the episode \\\"jibaro\\\" being for me a prime example of a beautiful story, nearly mythological, while having visuals which just keep one hypnotized.this series gives the creators a chance to fully utilise the format of short stories, as they are best approached differently from longer films, focussing on an intriguing narrative, in which one must not necessarily endulge, and letting the visual medium shine to its brightest potential.i highly recommend this series to everyone, yet especially those of you that like different and not so tipical stories, as well as visual style, as style can definitely be substance.\",\"this anthology is made of pure passion. its product of fascinating brain and imagination.\",\"i love animations but didn't like this series. it has too much of killing and violence and blood and also it's too fictional.

😍\\n.\\n.\\nneeded season 2\",\"fantastic. thought provoking. seed planting. concept exploring and not trying to answer questions though questions are placed well enough that you can decide for yourself.each episode is a different \\\"world\\\" or set of characters. mostly set in a world very much like ours now. entertaining in a way, but better than that. stimulating. you can try to guess where the stories going and all that but you're just missing the point and perhaps denying, that this is a mirror, showing back at us what we know is moments away if not here now.i have long felt that we often attack new technologies, phones, internet realms etc, pointing out the undesirable behaviours surrounding them, but really the only problem there is that we aren't equipped to handle these immense powers\\u002ftools. physical\\u002fmental evolution has been shocked by the unimaginable parabola of technological power we all have, even the poor, and the speed and leaps of imagination are only going to get crazier. soon, we could create new nations\\u002fplanets with each generation. not that we should. so far, we're already confronted with these challenges and our society as a planet is paying for the incongruity of what is possible and our old structure, the one we know. understandable.so, black mirror, highlights the weakness we deal with when confronted with our great power. the addictive and often extremely disheartening behaviours and inhumane reactions we have to this new world.most episodes could have been made into movies. not that they should have but could have which shows value. these 45 minute tales are tidy and well developed. if you like one you're likely to like them all just not all the same way. some the episodes are actually worth returning to as soon as your done. i won't say which. a number of episodes, i watched online, i immediately returned to a few key moments in the story after seeing the end of the episode. one of them i just went straight back to the beginning. good stuff. the usa needs more stuff willing to go there but we're so sensitive, fearful of saying the wrong thing, judgemental and crippled by originally well intentioned etiquette (or p.c. culture or whatever). i suppose we're not the only ones cause those very things are covered a bit in black mirror as well.\",\"usually animated shows are something one would love or hate. but this anthology is like a perfect steak in a sense that it's really really rare, bloody and something everyone (18+) can enjoy.\",\"some episodes of these series are amongst the most brilliant television ever.as each episode stands completely on their own you don't have to watchb them in order.most of the you can qualify under horror or science fiction, both not my cup of tea

standard.when i just hear about them i binged the 4 seasons then available in some days. don't. it's too alienating. people with unstable minds can get psychotic reactions.what makes them so great, and now i'm talking about the science fiction aspect, is that about aliens or stupid space chases. it's about now. they use the technologie now available but sometimes (luckilily) not yet integrated in our lives.sometimes it's about more future technology, or fantasy events but it's most of the times on a subtle way, not big special effects and brainless action. it always has a creepy, crazy, psychological twist.i can go on praising these series but i would say; watch!!!absolutely recommended.thet just aired the 6th season, i saw 3 from the 6 episodes and wow!!!\",\"season 1 set the standard and season 2 fell short of that pretty hard.none of them seem to go anywhere or had any point. no unique story to tell. except maybe the giant story but by then my interest was already lost in the season.\",\"but season 2 deserve at best 3 stars for the animation and sound design.. everything else is just a disappointing downgrade from season one.\",\"never saw the trailer. just saw it while browsing netflix, didn't knew what to expect. but the first episode just blew my mind. so awesome. it was like watching watching a video game. the episodes are small but so good. no nonsense. superb !!!\",\"many stories, many plots, definitely one big netflix original show, this show must he one of the reasons to keep paying netflix, i want a season 2\",\"definitely worth a watch. allthough not every episode is really that \\\"good\\\". i would recommend to check the different episodes ranking on imbd. there arent many bad episodes but you could save some time skipping 2,3 pointless entries. my personal favs are helping hand and good hunting!\",\"binged all 3 seasons and gotta say, bad traveling (season 3 ep 2) was my favorite! \\\"at times we crack, only to let the light in!\\\"\\ni also love the 3 robots exit strategy. jibaro was visually stunning, but confusing and i felt i was being slapped in the face with images a lot of the time which didn't make we enjoy it as much as i could have.snow in the desert and automated customer service were a great watch. i already feel like that old woman and her dog (when it comes to tech lately) :o and all through the house, was a creepy surprise so, those were may favs of season 2.zima blue, lucky 13, the dump, good hunting, sonnies edge and suits as well as three robots were the best in season 1. i love the robots and the cat! ha hahahaha those poor robots would be terrified to step into my house. ;doverall, a nice mix of different styles of animation and story telling, mixed with horror and sci-fi that made this a fun binge!!;d.\",\"from the stories to the animation, this series is absolutely amazing. yes, don't get me wrong, a few episodes are bit off, but of the 2 seasons only missing the mark on 1 maybe 2 episodes is fine. the stories are captivating and draw you in, albeit only lasting 10-15 minutes, the animation styles are incredible, and the entire production of each episode is so perfectly assembled, it'll be tough to not be extremely critical now of other animated sci-fi shows. highly recommend, and might i add i really hope some of these stories get their due by receiving full seasons (but then again part of why you get sucked in is the limited story).\",\"an absolute disappointmentthere's only one episode (#4 snow in the desert) that came close to s1's quality. #3 pop squad was also good but took a bit long to get to the point.all the other episodes were just weak and thrown together👎the producers or even the individual creators of some of the s1 episodes should really look into creating sequels, if not a series bc they were mind blowing and i still rematch them with my daughters every now and thenlet's hope they take their time for s3.\",\"even the \\\"weak\\\" episodes are better than most of the stuff that hollyweird is putting out.\",\"i watched all 3 seasons. 2 season had few episodes that were amazing. the one were the girl had to fight monster in a ring. great. the one where an albino outlaw guy had to survive, amazing. but wtf was the 3rd season? other than incredible last episode, the whole season was total garbage. i watched an entire season in 45 min because i skipped most of the episodes.\",\"these shorts go from 3 to 10 but overall a pleasant ride. some very cool ideas. some heavy metal vibes or ghost in the machine. check this out!\",\"i have never ever felt inclined to write a review for a movie or tv show in my life. i read reviews all the time\\nbut this show brought force to me to review it. not because i love it so much and not because it's terrible. but because it's truly one of a kind and for that it deserves a 10\\u002f10. every show on netflix is competing. this show is trying to bring something new and something new it brought. i'll be honest before i say this next statement if this has been said prior to me sorry for a repetitive statement but i didn't read many reviews before watching this show and then feeling the compulsion to write a review. it reminds be a lot of the twightlight zone with a modern twist. each episode is different and it's own plot. i'm only 4 episodes in but i get the idea. to keep this on the shorter side i will just get in to some pros and cons. the cons though are in no way to deter you from watching this show. watch it!pros:\\n1. animation like you have never seen before.2. different stories each episode.3. just out of this world stories. the scripts of nothing you have seen before and let's face it netflix has the same script over and over.4. bouncing of number 3 is the effort put into number 1. it's not like they relied on 1 to skate by. number 1 was just part of it.5. this show is going to be something that others can use to build off of. it's amazing animation, story telling, and uniqueness will live on as a legacy. my hunch is this show is going to inspire many others to something similar but much better.cons:\\n1. unfortunately, this series and innovative and original as it is far too short with every episode. i believe that's probably because it's expensive to make and they wanted to make as many stories as possible within the budget. i don't blame them but it is a setback on getting connected with a story and having it end in a few minutes.2. \\\"season 1 was an absolutely masterpiece but wtf was season 2?! it felt like teasers with no plots but with a vine time limit of 7 seconds\\\" this was a quotei saw on here and all i got to say 4 episodes in is this show has plot failures even in season 1 due to the short episodes. it's hard to play out a plot in 10 minutes.\",\"what a great series. the first season is unbelievable just great stories of trial pain suffering and loss. the second season full short a little but i don't think it's done yet. the animation in both seasons is just stunning at points you can't even tell what's real and what's cgi. the stories are very well written and i hope this continues season after season. i give it a 9.5. almost perfect. 1988.\",\"season one was a solid 9\\u002f10 for me. it mixed a diverse and often incredible array of animation styles.the writing, likewise, was much more hit than miss. even when it missed, the stories were still entertaining enough to keep you hooked for the next.thought provoking, funny, creepy, weird, sexy, cute, ugly, and everything in-between got covered, and covered well.with it sitting at 18 short episodes, you could comfortably crack a few beers, and treat it as a lengthy feature movie experience, and not get bored.then there is season two...painfully short, at 8 episodes. this felt like much less of an event. just as you are settling in, it's over.this isn't helped, by a much weaker selection of stories and in some cases, animation.granted, some are interesting. the first, \\\"automated customer service\\\", is funny, if taken a little too far, to the point of silly. \\\"snow in the desert\\\" is beautifully animated, and has a nice straightforward story, and the drowned giant, although slow is strangely enthralling and meditative (if poorly placed, as the last episode).then there are episodes like \\\"ice\\\". which feels like filler. lacking interesting animation, or any story of note. and pop squad, which while stunning to look at, feels like an idea that needs much more run time to be effective.season two isn't bad, per se. its just nowhere close to its preceeding season in quality, and it feels a lot like netflix rushed it out, in order to cash in on the popularity of the first.here's hoping netflix can redeem themselves with a bigger, ballsier season three. (but i fear we'll just get the other 8 episodes that were cynically withheld from season two!?!)\",\"i find myself amazed at the variety of deep and engaging storylines that left me at the edge of my seat... enraptured, in awe, perplexed, in love, angry and even clamoring for more.this anthology is unique in its offering and i can't wait for the second volume. nearly all of the visual novellas are masterpieces in their own right both in story and in animation style.\",\"i did not know what to expect. some are funny, some are harrowing, all are brilliant. i implore you to watch this. it is the best thing to hit netflix in a long time.\",\"the first season is very interesting and creatively much more diverse than the second.\",\"it's like these guys with the cardboard sign \\\"the end is near\\\" or these christian fanatics with \\\"homosexuality is a sin\\\". most episodes are just exaggerating actual society phenomenons. yes, technology is changing fast and with it our society and social behaviour. but most episodes feel like a sermon. pretty exhausting after 3 seasons. 6 stars, but because there are some decent episodes among the seasons, 7 stars.\",\"this animated anthology series is like someone took a blender, threw in a bunch of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror tropes, hit the puree button, and out popped this deliciously bizarre concoction. each episode is a self-contained story, ranging from the downright absurd to the oddly profound. you've got everything from sentient yogurt taking over the world to werewolf soldiers fighting in a futuristic war. yeah, it's that kind of wild ride.the animation styles vary from episode to episode, which keeps things interesting. one minute you're watching photorealistic humans, and the next, you're knee-deep in some trippy, neon-drenched fever dream. it's like a visual buffet, but how about the stories? some are clever, some are downright weird, and a few might leave you scratching your head wondering what just happened. but that's part of the charm. it's like they took all the craziest ideas from a sci-fi convention and brought them to life on screen.love, death & robots isn't for the faint of heart. there's violence, nudity, and enough f-bombs to make a sailor blush. but if you can handle a little animated anarchy, you're in for a treat. it's weird, it's wild, and it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you're into offbeat animation and stories that push the boundaries of what's possible.\",\"this has got to be the best anthology type show i have ever seen. i am astonished by how often an episode leaves me breathless. this show is at the apex of the current batch of brilliant tv shows. it is a commentary on contemporary society, technology, love, loss, remembrance, apathy, sympathy, pathos, and metaphysics. it is sometimes satirical, sometimes sad, and sometimes biting and sardonic. it is witty, beautifully written, directed and cast. wish it could go on forever.\",\"i'm flummoxed by some people up in arms about the first episode pushing some kind of feminist agenda. are they all part of the same loony men's rights group whining about the female dr who and the supposedly feminist mad max fury road? there is nothing here to empower women. watching some of these episodes, i picture a bunch of nerdy guys circle-jerking over their collectively sick and misogynistic imaginations.\\nthere is some extravagant and amazing animation here, but it's overcome by really shit writing. by which i mostly mean dialogue. by which i mean noticeably bad and grimace-inducing. written around some blatant recycling of previously original material. but it all looks 'wow' and it's loud and so on and what not. and i'm still watching, even though i feel queasy. like i said. i don't know how i feel about this. perhaps i'll find something worthwhile as i keep watching...\",\"the whole series was masterpiece with some really wonderful, thoughtful inputs. for me suits was the best episode of the whole series because of action and amazing twisted ending.\\ni liked every episode and enjoyed the action,comedy and thriller of this series. the best part was the creativeness of this series with really awesome work. at many place i was shocked to see such a wonderful work which is far more better than anywhere else.\",\"amazing! i'm absolutely loving this and i want to see more. plz let there be a series two :)\",\"season 1 was this amazing thing that netflix has given us and you could keep watching it over and over and not feel bored at all! the plot the cinematic vision was simply so great! but then came season 2. was so excited about it when it was announced and the expectations were so goddamn high that when i finally saw it was a a disappointment! plot wise nothing interesting is going on - no base, no twist just plain bland! the visuals are rich and hyper realistic and only saving grace for season 2!overall it's 10\\u002f10 for season 1 and 2\\u002f10 for season 2.\",\"i've never seen the trailers or heard of love, death + robots, but everybody was talking about it and so i decided to give it a watch. i was already hooked on the direction it was going for, i didn't expected to be much like black mirror but i'm not complaining. volume 1 was the most unique season i've ever watched. i love the different animation styles, how dark each plot is, and has a little twist to it. it was just brilliant to observe the visuals and original ideas.volume 2 was a bit different from volume 1. the animations were cool and there are some things i do enjoy from each episode, but it just wasn't the same which was quite disappointing. volume 1 seems like it was going all out while volume 2 was toned down which was a bore. nevertheless, i do enjoy this show a lot and hope to see more in the future.\",\"the best word to describe this is: unique.\\nbut not unique in any bad way. the stories are so brave and special. every episode has its own story and is about 10-15 minutes long. if you whached a couple of them you are most likely to be hooked. but after some really well written stories you'll find yourself watching some episodes that are not as great as others. but still those feel unique and still really entertaining. the show is often graphic and it's really going to some dark places. dystopian narratives as they should be. definitely recommend!\",\"i've watched this episode and its shocking in its brilliance. i'm sure to have nightmares tonight. omg\",\"love it. science fiction short stories rendered with cutting edge or experimental digital animation methods. don't let the hyper-violence of the first episode put you off. this alone was worth my months subscription to netflix.\",\"love, death & robots season 2: just 8 episodes of the animated sf series this time but all are worth watching.pop squad based on a story by paolo bacigalupi is about a future where humans are \\\"immortal\\\" but procreation is banned. well imagined, luxury and decay. resistance might be futile but ... 9\\u002f10snow in the desert brings one of neal asher's polity stories to life ( well, animation). fights between golem

awesome.....season 2 ...well not much, but it is still worth watching. i read reviews that the season 2 was so good and i kindoff disagree. it leaves you just craving enough for more. can't wait for season 3.\",\"can't remember any other show left me so speechless like this one. there are many great shows, but this one...every single episode left me overwhelmed with various emotions, every episode in it's unique way with unique story. i really can not describe content, story, hidden message or characters with just words, i can only scream please watch this! sometimes beginning of episodes may seem boring or dull, with slow developing story, but in the end every single episode gives you sucker punch that leaves you speechless.watch! watch! watch!\",\"this series took me on quite a mind trip. it leaves you wanting more. its visualy stunning and stands out.\",\"i really enjoyed most of season 1. they always packed lots into the short episode duration. zima blue, good hunting, the witness, aquila rift and the yoghurt one i've re watched loads of times.i didn't find one good episode in season 2, they all all seemed to have no real ending, like they'd just finish out of nowhere and i was always disappointed. definitely not going to be rewatching them.\",\"charlie brooker is the albert einstein in scifi story writing, the jules verne of our time. the series is dark, ingenious and thought-provoking. typically a series can stretch for years on a single storyline that works. the genius of charlie brooker is that he can come up with so many stories that are all unique and interesting. now this replaced mind hunter as my favorite show on netflix.\",\"beautiful, unique, and exceptional series! i wish the second season had more episodes.\",\"while the second season didn't add as much good stories as i hoped (which makes sense, it's not even half as long as season 1), love, death & robots still remains a great series,\\nwhich is capable of telling great stories with depth and meaning, but also just showing off funny ideas, in great & varying animation styles,\\nall in the span of less than 20 min each.easily recommended.\",\"can't wait for season 2 to come out!everything about this show is amazing!\",\"s1 is great. more than great. astonishing animation with lots of great plots. food for thought. it leaves you with a desire to go deeper into the meaning. s2 was great animation. poor plots. like you see a scene from a film. but not getting anything more than that. and only 8 episodes. so i guess that season 2&3 were one season split into two parts. i hope the good staff comes from episode 9-18.\",\"this is a difficult review. i would rate some episodes higher than 7, but i would also rate some episodes lower than 5.the bad: the point here is that some episodes are extremely cliche. for example, the second episode is a cluster of cliches regarding women and it is really mediocre. some episodes are meant to appear smart and critical of reality, but they don't do anything new. they re-use topics from other series and films (in a worse way) and embellish them with new animations.\\nfinally, maybe the comical episodes are not for me, but i didn't find them entertaining at all. i skipped them because i found them cringy and corny. thankfully there aren't many of them. but the comedy in such episodes is probably more appealing for kids (i'm not saying this in a derogatory way), it shouldn't be really entertaining for an adult.the good: some animations are good and others are very good. some plots are good, some plots are very good. there are a couple of episodes that i really liked as they delivered an original and interesting plot and i found myself wanting to know more about what was happening. some episodes manage to re-use topics that are already widely used nowadays (aliens, monsters and so on) but they manage to do so in an entertaining way.overall, i would say it is definitely worth watching. but since each episode isn't related to the others, i would also say some episodes aren't worth watching.\",\"seson1 was great. all of the episodes where just great. there was this feeling you could unfold the stories of each individual episode to make a new series out of it.second season it different. each episode has this feeling of completeness when the it ends.\",\"a nice series hoped there is another. it was incredibly enjoying and satisfying to watch.\",\"loved it, watched all episodes in one sitting, the stories and animation styles are in the same vein as a favourite movie of mine from long ago...heavy metal.\",\"i love the first couple seasons. they do a great job of being entertaining and thought provoking. i like that the episodes are self contained so you don't need to watch them in order.\",\"i was really excited to see this show on netflix as the premise seemed to echo along the lines of black mirror or the animatrix.unfortunately, this show is none of those things. the stories are vapid and \\\"edgy\\\" with random nude women and \\\"fucks\\\" thrown in for no reason except to realise the seemingly 12 year old writer's wet dream.we barely it though 3 episodes in the hopes things would change, but it didn't. don't waste your time on this, it's sad that they didn't pair the brilliant animators with some at least barely decent writers.\",\"this series is a collection of short stories. they are brilliantly rendered.season 1 is literally the gold standard of story telling in short format.season 2 is not bad. it doesnt match season 1, but still is excellent.\",\"i really really like this idea. short, well written and well executed animated shorts.all the episodes have something to offer in my opinion. maybe it's the sign of the times. maybe my own attention span is shorter these days.i think movies are too long nowadays anyway. even horror films are 2+ hours. bring back the 90 minute movies. it's a sigh of good writing and directing to make short films that captivate you.the jibaro episode, season 3 episode 9, is one of my favorites. very creepy and also fantastical. everything with this episode is great. the animation, directing, story and especially the ambience of sound.\",\"each and everyone has the uniqueness. different genres that make it clear awesomeness. the last one is huge and heavy. must watch animation shorts. personally i prefer the witness, the secret war..\",\"one bye one cyberpunk masterpieces! looking forward to season 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\",\"this series is amazing. it's thoughtful, surprising, sexy, and seriously addictive to watch. it reminds me of heavy metal mag from years ago. the variety of this anthology makes it superb. the artwork is fantastic and the story lines will draw you in and keep you begging for more.please netflix, give us more!\",\"this is a brilliant show! it is extremely disturbing and at the same time ingenious. it took me a year to watch second episode as i was too in shock from the first one. however it makes you question our time, our lives and society in general. i can't compare it to anything i've seen so far. each episode leaves you speechless and the only thing you can actually say after a while is omg!\",\"not literally, although there's is plenty of steamy scenes.\\ni've never binged watched a series all the way through in one sitting.... until this.\\neach episode individual, unique, attention grabbing and with their own surprising twists.\\ngive it a try. you'll like it.\\nnot for kids though, due to its graphic violence and sex scenes. although equally matched with humour and cinematography.\",\"i am not a particular fan of anthology series. this is because they frustrate me in the fact that some of the episodes will be great, and some will be horrible or forgettable. this one has the same problem. some of the episodes are great - for example the robot tourist episodes are funny, and the episode entitled bad sailing could be a feature length movie it's that good. there are a few other ones that are good, but i can't explain the premise of the story without giving away the story. but mostly that episodes either attempt to blow you away with great animation - although a lot of it does stray into the uncanny valley - or they try to shock you with some titillating or horrifying scene. it gets boring after a while. so i would suggest if you do check this out to find the best episodes and just watch those.\",\"i honestly can not do this justice in my review but if i can tell you anything it is to watch it!!.\\nfor such short anthology episodes it grips you instantly you feel some kind of bond to the charachters very fast at it leaves you wanting full feature films from each one .\\nthe minds behind this are nothing short of amazing from dialogue to the graphics and vibe each episode gives you cant wait for more !\",\"had i posted this after season 1 it would have been 10 stars, brilliantly innovative every episode made you think. season 2 though 1 star, simply lacks the quality of story and twists in tail that made season 1 so brilliant.season 3 better than 2 but still dismal in comparison to the first season.\",\"of course, since there are many shorts to choose from, one can say the \\\"lesser are brought up by the better.\\\"\\nhowever, each has it's own appeal and are very well done.\\nwatch it, not once but several times.\\nwell done.\",\"sometimes i'll watch shows even if they're a bit out of my comfort zone if they're top notch. figured with the reviews i'd give it a shot. i watched the first 2 and part of the 3rd episode and realized i'd seen as much as i needed and called it quits.\\nthe animation and plot concepts are a bit intriguing but i didn't feel it was close to redeeming enough to justify all the explicit content. these shorts aren't masterpieces\",\"i did not expect nothing. but this is a great anime anthology. i wished they would make films out of the clips.\",\"gorgeous dark animation with a very well crafted short tale by peter f. hamilton.\\ni almost thought it was the main antagonist was actually real and not animated.\\nlike this series there are many such shorts on youtube from various studios well worth the watch if you haven't already seen them.\",\"tim miller's ld+r is an instant favorite. an anthology of (mostly) animated short r (ma) rated films no more than about 16 minutes in length.the short format means there's almost no time for plot or character building. miller tends to focus either on one intense event, or a montage of shorter events to paint a broader portrait of the world or a specific character. he also holds nothing back in the departments of gritty dialog, over the top gore, and overt sexuality. he does away with just about every nicety we were taught as children so if that's not your thing then look elsewhere.each episode introduces a new fantastic world so perfectly portrayed that i find myself wishing many of them would break out into their own series. the artists who brought miller's stories to life are like magicians.netflix hits another home run. go watch this one (ones) right now! the episodes are not linked in any way, they do not share the same universe and there is no tying plot, so pick any episode and enjoy!\",\"episode 1 is good, at least i was enjoying that. but then episode 2, 3, 4 feels way too american with tipical american \\\"jokes\\\" and plots, this show certainly will be loved just like marvel movies are so popular. but not something for me. i prefer game of thrones, black mirror, witcher type of stories and dialogues at this decade.\",\"so i've seen a lot of the episodes. the strength of the series is definitely the ability to take aspects of modern life and spin them to their logical extremes to make a point. so, for example, you take a world that shares and rates every aspect of our lives on social networks and imagine a world where those networks aren't just harmless wastes of time but can actually impact your ability to get a job or find a place to live. or you look at our modern democratic system that constantly monitors public opinion to make policy and imagine a situation where a politician must do truly disgusting things to appease the masses, even at the expense of their dignity and family.there's nothing wrong with these ideas; science fiction has a long and storied history of critiquing society to point out potential issues and moral hazards. the problem i do have is the way the stories wind down and the conclusions they draw. almost without exception the conclusions are bleak. characters never make the right choices or even if they do they are inevitably crushed by the systems they rebel against.if you think of these stories as little horror movies, it's the point at the end of the film where the survivors either get to walk away having experienced something horrible but having survived and learned a little bit about themselves along the way, or they all get slaughtered and the last scene is the final survivor being pulled back down into the darkness by the monster and the camera panning twenty feet over to the safety they almost reached.both types of endings have their place. but when you choose to use only one of them the negativity starts to get a bit stifling. there has to be hope sometimes or it just feels depressing and pessimistic. i suppose this may just be a personal thing, others may not mind the continuously bleak outlook, but for me it gets really hard to watch more than one or two of these in a month.the acting is usually pretty decent, as are the production values. the writing is also usually quite decent, although they often stretch logic to the breaking point to get the ending they envision. i guess this would be a mini spoiler warning, but there is one episode where a sophisticated device malfunctions to lethal effect because of interference from a common, everyday piece of personal electronics, the equivalent of a commercial airliner hurtling into the ground because you didn't turn your cell phone off. to call that absurd doesn't really even begin to cover it; it could never happen.so in the end, my feelings about the show are rather mixed. to some degree i really like the creativity of the concepts and the decent execution, but on the other hand i find myself feeling rather depressed by the constant negativity and a little irritated that i can usually guess how the story will end half way thru because it is always the most bleak ending that they run with.\",\"sex, splater and short strong storys with allways a new kind of artstyle. i was adicted to the series. its on a level like rick & morty. i like more, mutch more and hope the next seasson has 20+ episodes.\",\"season 1 deserves 9\\u002f10 if not even 10\\u002f10season 2 is just so bad! it's a shame honestly, been looking forward for it.\",\"after this show, life is complete. now i can have a whole new breed of nightmares. absolutely amazing! brilliantly done. there is nothing else like it.\",\"i wish netflix made more of such content than all of the nitty bitty unwatchable stuff. this show is amazing!!i still remember watching the 1st season back in 2019, and having my mind blown by the different styles of animation and the strong impact the stories had even tho being so short.\",\"netflix have done something truly great here.\\nthis collection of short works is a fresh dose of awesome. unique and different styles of animation and storytelling. watched 7 episodes and just had to jump on here to write what is in fact my first ever review on imdb after nearly a decade of being a member.just like how book anthologies can give us a great reading experience love, death and robots allows us to enjoy the creative works of different people.this has endless potential as each season is not bound by a singular cast and plot. its just a bunch of great short films.hope to see season 2 soon.\\n9\\u002f10\",\"so this anthology is entertaining for the most part. the episodes that are great are really fantastic. 10\\u002f10 for several (mainly the early ones). most of the 18 are mediocre at best. some are interesting, some boring and predictable. several have incredible animation. i would say the fantastic ones are: three robots, the witness, beyond the aquila rift, and sonnies edge. the terrible ones are the dump, sucker of souls, blindspot, alternate histories. the rest are somewhere in between. worth it to watch the series, but nowhere near the ridiculous hype everyone seems to be talking about.\",\"my favorite scifi shows are the original twilight zone, x-files, twin peaks, stranger things, maniac, manifest, and fringe. what a great show this is. it's stunning! the writing puts most other shows to shame. i don't care if it's cliché, but san junipero was my favorite episode. this one stood out to me the most. some of the other episodes were more heart pumping and filled with action, but i really enjoyed the story on this one. acting is also stellar across all episodes. short review, but if you like the other shows i've listed, you'll really enjoy this one.\",\"brilliant insights of where technology can take us. throws out the deep agony human instinct and technology coupled take us. for sure not the average series you see.\",\"third season in my opinion is much better, story and enternteinment wise, than second season. but none can compare to the first one, obviously.one review mentions this season being dark and dreary... well dooh, it's in the name \\\"love, death + robots\\\". after season 1, i expect this show to be dark(death) with some hope(love) sprinkled in and taking a background and sometimes just for fun robots added.only disappointment that it's just 9 episodes.\",\"i mean, it's just random episodes, but what's better? the surprise of not knowing what comes next. the thing in every episode is that if there's action or not, there's always a punchline to it.not to even talk about cgi and animation. it's beyond this world. it's the youtube duration type of episode that makes you binge this. they could make this series run literally forever if they had the resources.\",\"no where near as great as vol 1, plus 10 episodes shorts of vol 1 as well. felt a little lack lustre this time round. a few of the episodes were great, but over all vol 1 was spectacular.\",\"my brother put me on to this show. the latest season is the best one yet. great show especially if you're a sci-fi tech fan.\",\"one of netflixs best shows amazing shorts most of which are superb a great show in so many genres sci fi horror fantasy and comedy a real recommendation for a binge worthy fix\",\"i really enjoyed the series and thought netflix did a great job making each episode unique, not only with the story lines but the total presentation.\\njust watch it, you'll definitely like it!\",\"this series is an absolute joy to watch.. but i have an issue with shape shifters. why would you base a story on united states marines and not try to be remotely accurate in how you portray them? any marine would correct the uniform and rank flaws for free because it annoys the hell out of us all to see these mistakes. and a marine, would never refer to themselves or any other marine, even the most garbage marine, as \\\"soldier\\\".. the story and animation were great but i wanted to claw my own eyes out seeing the multitude of mistakes that google could've easily prevented..\",\"just fall flat. i love how dark and semi realistic this show is but it feels like every other episode is not that interesting. some episodes seem like they're focusing more on the artistic filming than the actual plot. both are obviously important but a beautifully filmed episode with little or uninteresting plot (or massive plot holes) is not worth watching. i love that this show focuses on the ways humanity can become perversed by technology but the more recent episodes look more like futuristic distopian stuff where the characters are all play into their most depraved desires rather than normal people being corrupted by tech or the opportunities it can bring\",\"it's netflix after all, so of course they had to kill it.\",\"yeah, the headline tells you the everything. its so ridiculous, hilarious, epic and masterpiece. the art, the story, dubbing... they are all mindblowing. warning: you will want to finish them all at one sitting, so, make sure that you have at least 4 hours-free-time. enjoy that netflix original artwork-masterpiece.\",\"this is a show like none other i have ever seen in my life. the descriptions says its sci-fi show, but the story line makes the technology part take a back seat and show cases how humans can be cruel and petrifying in a way never imagined before. this show is not for the faint-hearted though, it gets really dark and horrifying. though not supernatural some episodes like \\\"be right back\\\" and \\\"white bear\\\" will petrify even the strongest of nerves.\",\"dark, twisted entertainment, with fantastic (varied) animation. what's not to love about this series. good job netflix, let's have some more like this.\",\"\\\"love, death + robots is such a unique series, combined with incrediblely high level animation and live-action, with a great and interesting different story in every each episode, makes love, robots + death a fantastic journey, i highly recommended\\\"\",\"need more films as those werewolves in \\\"shape shifters\\\"\\nsadly, nowadays we only get big dogs and\\u002for wolves, which people will then refer to as \\\"werewolves\\\" in movies. it's annoying.. or we get people who are a bit more hairy with a bit of makeup.. also not good enough for me..\\nif anyone reading this are familiar with the \\\"underworld\\\" movies, you then know what i mean when i say real werewolves..i liked a lot of the other episodes as well.\\noverall 10\\u002f10 for me. saw it all in one go.\",\"definitely something different. episodes 1,2,3 and 7 my best so far. some episodes tho are really lacking and almost seem to have no point and nothing like the ones mentioned. now if they created a series based on episode 1,2,3,7.... damn!season 2, about 3 episodes worth keeping.season 3, vfx was good but wth was up with the stories this time? a complete let down! motto keeping a single episode👎😐\",\"a series of science fiction shorts, just with any doctor would order. astonishingly wonderful. absolutely the best television\\u002fseries type show i've watch this season without a doubt. creative, artistic, varied material each segment, all of the shorts are 10 to 20 minute snippets from quite different producers with completely different plots... some more creative than others. the \\\"yogurt that took over the world\\\" was my favorite this season, even though they were more powerful episodes. enjoy!\",\"bless you, netflix, for giving us this.bless you.\",\"i suffered through each episode hoping something would redeem this show, i think i would have preferred being waterboarded. half-assed pointless stories with little meaning. feels like they were written by a 10 year old.\",\"this is an excellent series, each season is quite short, and each episode is an entirely separate story, with different cast and producers, so you can watch the episodes entirely on their own.the red line connecting all episodes is how technological advances in a possibly quite near future might impact our lives. and here the focus is on possible side effects and misuses of the possibilities of new technology.it is many times a journey into the darker sides of humanity in a dystopic future. but also how good intentions of new technology conflicts with our aspirations as good humans to have a loving and meaningful life. there is a wide spectrum of stories in this show, from very emotional love stories to dark sci-fi horror. so there is a very big variation in the episodes. and everyone start watching should find some real golden nuggets to like.stories are well thought out and seems quite realistic. no overplayed action or violence, you basically just know it is there to take the story forward which is good.the show is really addicting to watch, you just want more of this mind expanding, thought provoking and sometimes frightening and disturbing stories about us as humans in a possible future. an amazing show, masterclass of stories and actors. i really look forward to season 5.\",\"few shows tap into the animation of people as much as this show,is every episode great?no i'd say ,but ever single episode is unique it's in own right and is a fresh new idea .this show takes a cliché idea or premise and changes it in. big way too make its own original story,for example sonnies edge cyberpunk fighting matches aren't particularly unique,megalobox did that before this but this show episode is so special simply because of the variations of the people and objects in it, for instance the monsters they they fight with, both monsters have their own specialties and areas of expertise , that element of the monsters makes them infinitely more interesting than just a vessel for main character, and the over arcing plot in this episode is extremely fascinating and is in and of itself is very intriguing story, throw monsters beating each other to death, and it is just amazing,every episode is like that,something cliché done in the least cliché way possible, in other words it has its own spin on the formula,and this show has some of most breathtaking animation and animation styles in animation,the realism in shapeshifter's is nothing short of breath, and the animation style in sims blue is perfection, this show takes a very different approach to very cliché ideas and inserts its own concepts with him, i strongly recommend this show.\",\"fantastic frist season, good stories. was really looking forward to season 2, but four episodes in , its looking very disapointing.\",\"on the wall. what the best tv series of them all?well, this is certainly one of them. black mirror trapped me, looking into it's gaze and i loved what i saw staring back at me. each story is different, but all episodes have an undercurrent of technological variations. it highlights what society will become (and in some cases already is), from being completely obsessed with our phones and social media (society is well past this point), to the afterlife and how we might best use technology for the power of good...and love. there were perhaps 2 weak episodes for me personally, one being 'men against fire' (yawn) and the second being 'white bear'. they for me were just a bit boring and done to death. all the other episodes border from sublime - to breathtakingly beautiful. all of the episodes are wonderfully acted though. do not miss out on this. disturbing yes- but it reflects a world we actually inhabit now - damned until the end of this civilisation, shackled to our phones and selfies. some may look at themselves differently after this- i certainly did. judging by this body of work, the writer charlie brooker is, quite frankly a genius.\",\"truely masterpieces of short stories inclusive next gen cinemati art.\",\"the first season was one of the most innovative anthologies i've ever seen, even though there were a few that didn't catch my taste. season 2, by total contrast, was a big disappointment. worst of all was \\\"ice\\\", which has no story to speak of and, what's worse, wasn't even interesting from a visual standpoint. but the others weren't much better. the amount of violence and inhumanity was grotesque at some points. overall the second season felt soulless and, no surprise, didn't feel as innovative as the first one.\",\"first of all, the visuals were outstanding. there were many different types of animation and some of them were breathtaking.the stories were another machine altogether. most of the stories were written by men that were based on stories written by men. a bit convoluted but there you go. alberto mielgo is a prepubescent boy hiding in the body of a man and this is obvious to anyone that looks at his work. i no longer wonder why sony fired him. philip gelatt has very little talent which is probably why they get him to rewrite crappy stories into even crappier stories. maybe he has a brain parasite that only allows him to interpret everything into a teenage boy's wet dream, lol. who knows? who cares?i saw a lot of sex, and machines\\u002frobots being sexualized but i didn't see any love. the series should have been called sex, death and robots. the stories themselves were unoriginal and for the most part, boring. lots of war\\u002fblowing things up, trying to be clever, but it's all old and it's awful.not impressed but had to give it a 3 out of 10 for the animation style and that's it.\",\"this show is seriously incredible! every episode is so intriguing and great in it's own unique way and it really gets you thinking. if you're considering watching this absolutely do it! i watched it the first time thinking \\\"oh idk if i'll like this it kinda seems weird\\\" and now it's my favourite show and i've watched it several times! there's at least one episode for everyone but i was personally captivated by every single episode. this is my go to show to recommend to anyone and everyone.\",\"we can reduce this series to a single sentence: \\\"technology seriously harms you and others around you\\\". ohmygod, when i read some comments like \\\"a thought-provoking series\\\" i can't help but laugh. or throw up (which happened to me while watching first episode, incredibly grotesque and disgusting). there's no new thought that has not already been addressed in the last decades in this stuff. we can count on the fingers of one hand the episodes that they have something interesting to tell us. most of them are ridiculous and stupid. i don't understand the very high score and comments ridiculously complimentary.series for the simple-minded.\",\"this tv show is truly remarkable. it has everything you could ever want in a show: compelling themes, great writing, and a captivating cast. every episode is carefully crafted to bring out the complexities of the human experience and explore the hard social questions that we face in our society.one of the standout features of the show is how it incorporates technology into its themes. while some of the technology depicted may seem far-fetched, it's not difficult to imagine that we could be living in a world with such advanced tech in the not-too-distant future. just take a look at the ai and drones that we already have.watching just one episode of this show can leave you thinking about it for days. it's the kind of show that stays with you and makes you question your own beliefs and values. if you're looking for a show that will challenge you and make you think, then this is the one for you.\",\"i feel like netflix is trying really hard to be cool and forgets the ultimate goal of creating actual content. the show is not bad, but it doesnt feel original, i dont mean original as a plot but as a tv show category. many new shows are really entertaining, like umbrella academy which was really fun, but they dont touch you like other shows did in the past. its like they dont care anymore about the character development, but only about the catchy lines, the wanna-be dark humor\\u002fsarcasm, the \\\"coolness\\\" in general. i hope i am wrong. anyway, the two first episodes were ok, nothing wow, but not bad either.\",\"this is the biggest surprise i came across these last couple of years. this series is one of the best i've seen. every episode is unique yet criticizes the same absurd society we're living in. i was shocked at the great filming\\u002facting\\u002fdirecting and of course writing of these different stories. my personal favorite would be episode 2. the most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. that's the biggest mistake he could do. definitely the best episode. i wont miss anything else charlie brooker does and i'm patiently waiting for the dvd to come out. i hope this also gets a blu-ray version and maybe some new episodes after wards?\",\"lets be honest guys this series i v seen better love death and robots my favorite series after 100 i realy love it and i ll watch again one day.\",\"basically what this is is an anthology of animated shorts for a mature audience. think heavy metal, liquid television or the animatrix. that sounds like a cool idea, but not all the shorts are very good. some are animated in that hyper-realistic video game cutscene robert zemeckis style, which i really don't understand. what's the point of it being animated if you're going to make it look as realistic as possible? why not just make it live-action? a lot of these shorts are pretty much just big long action scenes, nothing really too original or interesting. there's also the mature content, which goes too far sometimes. some of these shorts would play out exactly the same if you took out the sex, gore and swearing, it just isn't always necessary and comes off as try-hard and childish. however, with all that said, some of these shorts are absolutely beautiful with breathtaking animation, creative concepts and inspired imagery. this is stuff i love in animated shorts, and love, death and robots definitely delivers on that, just not all the time. if you like animated short anthologies all done in different styles and genres, ldr is worth a watch. it's not that great as a whole, but it has some really great stuff in it.\",\"most reviewers are finally in agreement...this series really deserves the praise it's getting...already in its third season with many more, hopefully, to come...\\nstories...animation...even the comedy is good. and sure, not all of them are great, but the ones that are more than make up for the ones that are, in any way, lacking...\\nmost of the ones i watch, somewhere along the way i have to remember my mouth, hanging open in amazement at just how good these are. i'm kind of surprised that some of the other cable networks haven't tried to copy the (varied) format. you'd think they'd want a piece of the action...\\nin any case, i hope this series continues for a long time...something to look forward to, yearly.\",\"i had decent expectations from season 2. the stories has no depth as such..its superficial and the animation is not extraordinary..rewatch the first season instead. some stories are not even original even if it has 8 ep..\",\"season one was amazing, season 2 was ok but not really worth a re-watch. excited to hear of season 3 so will be picking that up on day 1.so i need to increase to 150 characters, and that's what this sentence is for.\",\"brilliant - loved the first season and loving the second. hope there's going to be a third.\",\"watching it was disturbing and shocking at the same time. depressive in a way, but also genius and defying! the way it makes you question and think about reality and our modern technological ages it's brilliant!and although being fictional and mostly sci-fi, it's so realistic in the scariest way! it's not about tech... it's about us and our \\\"human nature\\\", the good and the bad, our best and worst as humans and that is definitely the most disturbing aspect of it all. worth seeing it all with detailed attention cause it's probably one of the most intelligent and critical tv series done recently!! thank you mr brooker and all the team!p.s.: the first two episodes are probably the most disturbing ones and it's curious that all the bad reviews focus only in the first one... reading those bad reviews only make more sense to the all series idea... shocking uh? but wouldn't we be all in the pub watching it?\",\"despite most of the episodes are cgi and\\u002for animation, this is not a series for children. 18+ only.and considering each episodes are only approximately 30 mins long, each episode's production value are extremely high. i'm talking big budget movie blockbuster quality high. i found most of the storyline, original and immensely imaginative - not to mention extremely varied.verdict: surprisingly an uber good series. the only con is, there isn't enough episodes per season.\",\"some of the episodes are pretty good. some aren't so good. but overall if you like anthologies geared towards fantasy, horror, and science fiction this series is ok.it's a little like the youtube channels alter, omeleto, and dust. these youtube channels post independent filmmakers' content, and offer a lot of short format stories. so if you like love, death & robots you might check them out.in some of the episodes in love, death & robots the writers lay on the social and political commentary pretty thick. but hey, writers have been doing that for a long time. they also overrepresent women and minorities in their character selection and while i wouldn't say that doing so distracts from the episodes, it's very obvious what they are doing. but again, it's par for the course these days. so it is what it is.if you're triggered by seeing more minority and female characters, much fewer white males, or don't care for left leaning politics you might find some of the episodes to be turn off. but i say just grin and bear it. each episode is a self-contained story, and they're all pretty short. so if you stumble on an episode you don't like don't worry the ride isn't long.\",\"so far 2 seasons in, this series provides stories and shorts for everyone! while there may be some i don't like, it's hard not to appreciate the high budget and great voice acting in every single short. all styles presented are well animated and there's a very good sense of passion. typically with something like this where i may not like every short it may cap off at a 7 but i have yet to see a bad story, bad style or anything. this is a fantastic watch. well done netflix.\",\"season 1 was an absolutely masterpiece but wtf was season 2?! it felt like teasers with no plots but with a vine time limit of 7 seconds... disappointing asf.\",\"was looking so forward to season two. horrible letdown. no real storyline, mediocre animation. seemed like they just rushed to make up things. skip this season and hope if there is another one it's infinitely better.\",\"i feel like some of the episodes in season 2 were a little too short, and there were less than half as many episodes as season 1, so all in all season 2 was a little disappointing. it's not bad; season 1 just set the bar too high.the animation is absolutely gorgeous, though.\",\"some of the digital graphics in this series are outstanding, incredible examples of the future of graphics and technology. that's why it gets 3 stars.however, as for the stories themselves, that's all it mostly is, a tech demo. the stories are all mostly paper thin, like the rough outline of the beginning of a screenplay, and the worst part? almost no completion to the stories as presented. also, as a side note, often times the brief amount of time i spent with each character, i found them to be overwhelmingly annoying.how much fun does it sound to watch the beginning of 26 films, with almost no resolution? that's this series.oh, and the \\\"love\\\" part of this series is mostly just gratuitous digital nudity that adds nothing to the stories, that could have been time better spent telling an actual story that has a beginning and (most importantly) ending.\",\"i'll start by saying that i'm an impatient viewer in the sense that i can't watch series that are long or have multiple seasons because when i start an interesting story i am super curious about the finale. indeed i prefer movies or miniseries because i know that i have the free time to watch it all in a day without having to wait multiple days before i can finish it. and that's what brought me to this \\\"love, death & robots\\\", indeed all the episode are short stories that are maximum 17 minutes long. the surprising thing is that all the episodes were not a waste of time and i appreciate all of them, clearly i loved some and others were instead a mere ok. but it was great to open a episode and having an entertaining short story to watch. the serie is all animated and technically fantastic, with some episodes that has a realistic 3d cgi and others that experiments more with some more artistic realisation. the other great aspect of \\\"love, death & robots\\\" is the diversity of the stories because there are for all the tastes: action, thriller, horror vibes, monsters, sci-fi , war and surrealism are all present. even the scopes are very different: some episodes want to teach a moral, others have the only scope to entertain, there are a few displays of style and some satirical ones.\\nin conclusion i really really liked this serie and i think that everyone will appreciate something different about it. a must watch on netflix.\",\"season 1 is a 10. great ideas, animations, explorations of how the animations are given, styles, story, and the amount of content.season 2 is a 8. some great ideas, animations are solid, but not enough content. maybe we were spoiled with season 1, but there should have been more episodes and ideas like season 1.\",\"if you like black mirror or reading short stories then this show is perfect for you.\\ni really want a season 2\",\"i knew i loved it when i wanted to see a whole movie of every episode. i love every minute of every episode, great variety of concepts, different art styles and story telling. how can anyone hate this.\",\"i honestly cannot believe how people are not aware that these are animations from a variety of studios, and that studios have been almost entirely remote during the pandemic; making organizing quite difficult.season 2 was absolutely horrid on the story but i still find myself impressed with the graphical design...it make me question if other shows i was watching were just cgi and i had to snap back to reality.every single episode (season 2) felt cut short....which was disappointing for all the amazing effort, but perhaps if people recalled, that is because there is a pandemic.i sense season 3 will be a little closer to the story-rich quality of season 1 with actual endings and intentions of 'gotcha' finales.\",\"the first trailer showed crazy animations. it has 2d, 3d, motion captured animations in each episode. what i didn't know that each episode has their own genres in different stories. i stopped watching it because, personally, it certain nudity in various animations gave me an eyesore.\",\"season 1 is incredible - it came out of nowhere and it was such a blast. lots of unexpected animation shorts which were very different but also sharp, peculiar, vivid, sarcastic, heroic, dreamy and many other things - and above all, great fun.in comparison, season 2 is a bland, uneventful and twice as short. just a few episodes are made in distinctive style, the rest is just high quality 3d animation, and almost none of them except maybe the first and the last really stand out from the story\\u002fidea perspective.\",\"overally all of the episodes were good but some of them was a masterpiece.\",\"i love the tv show it's amazing!\\nsince it's the vivid-19 pandemic & people are addicted to netflix, why don't you produce an episode related to a virus pandemic in the future?\",\"a rare drama of a hundred years,better than the movie of the same name.\",\"the stories! the animation! it is truly an amazing visual spectacle, each episode is unique, raw and fascinating. it is one of the few series on streaming i will rewatch over and over, still finding cool details. great job netflix.\",\"if i'd rated this before season 3, this show would be an easy 10\\u002f10. but with each season after 2, the quality of the episodes continuously decreases with the occasional surprise, and then finally the mountainside plane wreck of season 5.season 1: 10\\nseason 2: 10\\nseason 3: 7\\nseason 4: 3\\nseason 5: 1averaged out (and weighted because seasons aren't all the same length) show comes to 6\\u002f10\",\"season 1 featured 18 shorts that were, for the most part, very entertaining although often featuring nudity for the sake of nudity. they were short but told interesting stories that left you thinking about what might have happened after the ending. seasons 2 and 3 have fewer but longer episodes, which is a blessing and a curse. there are fewer to bore you, but it takes longer to get through each one. they were almost all lessons in how great and photorealistic computer animation can be, but they lacked quality storytelling, not to mention that they were almost all dark and depressing. the only bright light was provided by the three robots. my rating of seven primarily speaks to the strength of the season 1 offerings.\",\"ever walk away from an episode or a movie changed? where you think back frequently and day dream about the what if? even if not, i swear you will find out with this show. i beg you to give it a chance. i stumbled on this series at my friends house imploring me to continue and now i

interested in long drawn out series, why does everything have to turn into a soap opera. i love movies for the basic beginning middle and ending! these are super creative shorts that tell a storey or make a entertaining point without taking hours upon hours to do it.\",\"a trend you'll notice with the first volume is people only give high marks to the \\\"serious\\\" episodes. volume 2 is every bit as perfect as the first. i can't wait to rewatch it as much as i did before.\",\"i see some reviewers here arguing about the lack of stories in the episodes.\\nif the proposal was to tell stories

us small samples of parallel universes, of past or future possibilities. and in that, they were geniuses.\\nimpeccable production, perfect animations.\\nthey showed us exactly what they wanted to show, and we just have to sit and enjoy this masterpiece.\",\"season 1, a mind blowing masterpiece with plenty of episodes to indulge. season 2, a disgrace to season 1. not only is it incredibly short after a 2 year wait, but the writing is just sloppy. season 1 had a lot of episodes that made you think \\\"wow, how does someone come up with this\\\" while season 2 as a whole seems like something you could scrap together with a couple friends over a weekend.i pray this is a lesson to the people who decided to switch up this season, and that if they do get another chance with a third that they redeem themselves. there are great writers and artists out there who are forced to have limited creativity. let them make something freely.\",\"i loved season one but thought i'd write a positive

crazy about it. it covers almost all animation styles, so to speak, each episode is well made. in addition, the core of the story is very creative, rich in imagination. i love this animated series so

episode is a gem, with a different story, a different technique of animation.its like watching an animated short story version of black mirror (another show which i truly admire).if i had to rate this

season.\",\"as soon as i saw the trailer headline on netflix i knew i was absolutely going to love this work of art and boy let me tell you i could not stop watching. every single episode was stunning

when it comes to their unique and creative ideas. crazy excited about season 2.\",\"i think im priviledged to say i have found this show early on. its like a mix between the quality of blackmirror

between. the way in which it portrays adult themes sucha sex and gore is profoundly amazing. i cant recomend this show enough. the episode are those which one will continue to watch after they have binge watched the entire season. the timing of each unique episode is perfect and there is now need to make them longer. the only thing that would make this better would be more episodes.\",\"this show is amazing! very good short stories, graphics are flawless, distorted graphics and voices are on point, and i enjoy how dark some of the episodes are. extremely creative. season 1 was the best in my opinion because this series was so random and watching all 18 episodes i just couldn't wait for the next one.season 2 was honestly kind of trash. i'm not gonna lie. there were at least 2 decent episodes but the rest of it i was just extremely confused and disappointed because i knew they could've a lot better.season 3 was a lot better. i just think that they could have added more episodes and made the good ones alittle longer also. the suspense was most definitely on point. overall though i hope to see more seasons in the future.\",\"first things first i love crude humor. and i love dark humor. i just find this series too presuming, too confident in it's pretentious ideas.though it looks great and the production values in general are very, very admirable.\",\"started watching this show on netflix over the weekend and i am hooked. such a different show than anything on tv right now. episodes make you think what the future could be like and how it may not always be such a

fantastic mix of different animation style, each bringing its own flavour to the story.the feeling it gives is a mix of animatrix and first episodes of black mirror, where you just watch in awe and can't possibly stop.absolutely worth watching\",\"i love the animation format and really wanted this to be black mirror but better. unfortunately that's not the case, only a few episodes took advantage of the medium, and i think there was a lot more that could have been done with the animation style.the stories are generally fine, one or two were interesting but mostly they're covering well-treaded ground. it's still worth watching and i enjoyed it, but i feel like there's a lot of lost potential.\",\"i just love this show. nothing makes you think like black mirror.it's definitely not for everyone, but if you manage to look past the bizarreness, pig f***ing etc. you're in for a treat. i've had hours and hours of debates with friends about the show. sharing and hearing opinions about the episodes is the best, because people notice different things and have different takeaways from each. it broadens your horizons and gives you a new perspective on life and the future.season 4\\nit's a shame it had to go mainstream and everything is now feeble and watered down for the masses. i know it can be f***ed up at times, but i actually watch bm for the bizarreness and the pig f***ing.half of the episodes just didn't make sense (memories from dna?) and the other half had weak twists or flat endings. before this season, everything was outrageous, but believable and maybe not too far off into the future. now it just doesn't make sense.i expected more from bm this season and it didn't live up to it, but it's still the best show i've ever watched.\\nfavorite season:

dawdling around s4, ep5\\u002f6. this is the way i watch bm - by watching one episode very infrequently and taking some months to recover from the enormity of the (let's hope erroneous) prediction. still no better scifi in 2019 imho.####i generally supply good reviews, however, very few tv series, films will ever get a rating of 10\\u002f10 from me. black mirror is one of those tv series.as a fan of sci-fi (i.e. ray bradbury, phillip k. dick two of my all time fave authors), the writing in black mirror (bm) is deserving of accolades accorded to the aforementioned greats. bm brings into sharp focus the trajectory humanity *could be* on (see prof stuart kauffman's concept of the 'adjacent possible') and extrapolates beyond our current smartphone reality to an altogether (sometimes) grimmer collection of alternative higher-tech futures. bm is great sci-fi for this principal reason. the cinematography provides some stunning visuals (ep 4 - san junipero) and perfectly blends periods across the time hopping story lines of some episodes. if you haven't watched season 3, do so, if you have, watch it again.\\\"those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.\\\" george santayana\",\"fear of technology. that is what this series seem to represent. how we are all enslaved by science and technology, which will ultimately doom us all. black mirror is basically fearmongering, especially about social media. almost every single episode's underlying theme is how facebook and twitter is this vile cesspool that only brings out the absolute worst in people and only spawns trolls, bullies and terrorists, a system that makes us all soulless total psychopaths reveling in mass murder and human suffering.black mirror seems to be made by old people. the kind, who only have a cursory understanding of modern technology, probably from the news and conspiracy nut blogs, and they envision this formless evil beast that will inevitably destroy humanity. we all fear what we don't understand, and the creators of this series are just bringing this concept to the extreme. you can see it in every episode: social media is evil tyranny, modern medical and scientific advances are just waiting to kill us all, and where one single person is enough to hack some automated system and go on a killing spree, while the authorities are just fumbling about completely powerless. aside from one single episode, season 3's \\\"san junipero\\\", the entirety of black mirror is totally ridiculous, pandering fearmongering, that exploits people's lack of knowledge about technology and sends a completely wrong message. this sort of luddite thinking and behavior is what lead to the dark ages...having said all that, black mirror is a surprisingly well put- together series. the production value is very high, and for a sci-fi tv series, the cgi is remarkably good. the stories (discounting the subject matter) are well written and well acted. some of the episodes tend to be sluggish and boring in places, but i chalk that up to the creators, who seem to be from the old-school sci-fi scene with strong hints of stanislaw lem and phillip k. dick influences.all in all, black mirror is very well made sci-fi series, that is just a bit too on the nose about it's hatred for modern technology and especially social media. it's definitely worth a watch if you can distance yourself from the ridiculous fearmongering.\",\"i don't know what happened, but the sci-fi element, the existential subtext, the reason black mirror was so profound, is lacking in season 6. who thought it was ok to do pedestrian stories? none of these, even the meta meta attempt to warn against ai, hit the mark. the show used to push the eerily gray conversation of what it meant to be in a world of technology, but season 6 is just shyamalan doing his rendition of twilight zone.i'm a long time fan of black mirror. the gems in the earlier seasons were complex, nuanced and full of ideas that pushed and tugged on world views and the concept of self. the terror and fascination held me in awe of what could be. it was a way to show the possibilities and consequences of our humanity, told in an exquisitely personal way. i still get chills watching the entire history of you, white christmas, white bear, playtest, and san junipero. the netflix seasons have taken a noticeably curt interpretation of what the series represents. and i know they don't like to do more than 3 seasons of stuff, but if you are don't skimp. don't hamper the goodwill and impact because you don't want to invest in qualitative oversight.down from a 10 to an 8.\",\"black mirror tells us the stories of some normal people's life, before and after technology ruins it. this serie of mini-films are telling us that technology has cons like it has pros. technology has to be developed carefully, otherwise it can harm more than help. this serie gives that lesson, and we should listen it.\",\"i had black mirror at a 10, even after the mediocre season 5. season 6 was just such a huge disappointment that it made me come back and write this review and change my rating to a 7. i'll start off with the positives, specifically for s6. you get 10\\u002f10 for meeting the diversity requirements. i won't say more about that which hasn't already been said, and i'm aware that the show was already incredibly diverse, but this was the first season where i sincerely felt it was forced.that said, the myriad of characters in s6:e1 were awesome and hilarious. best episode of the new season by far. great writing specifically. very clever, and i laughed throughout.anyone reading this review should know that seasons 1-4 are all mostly incredible tv, and you should not miss them. season 5... well ok. with season 6 you would be better off just watching the first episode which was the only one which had any sort of originality. after that, you get a twilight rip-off, a predictable space soap opera, and a shadow of a serial killer documentary, not to mention, the formulaic 'strong female character' throughout.season 6 is simply dialing it in. it's almost like watching your childhood hero getting fat and complacent. love you brooker, but i hope for better.\",\"really nothing new or that exciting here. most of this has been done before and it's certainly not as well written or interesting as black mirror.animations are great in some episodes and the voice acting can be good.overall it's very average and forgettable.\",\"black mirror has a unique vibe in its episodes. i really, really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. season 4 had some great episodes, also some less entertaining episodes. but season 5 doesn't feel like black mirror at all. it seems like the technological dystopia that every great episode had, was not recognized in season 5. it felt more like 3 short mainstream films to me. season 5 just wasn't dark enough and it was too expectable. the acting is good don't get me wrong, but the stories in the fifth season aren't like they were in seasons past. seasons 1-4 a solid 9, season five a 6, but in terms of relevance to black mirror, i wouldn't even rate it.\",\"review - black mirror let me start with a little explanation, black mirror is a series made up of separate stories, so from one to another each is different. that being said even though each episode is a different story one thing they have in common is that they are original. some episodes are scary, some make you think and some are just strange but each is compelling viewing. as each episode is its own story if you don't like the subject of one skip to the next because so far there are 4 series (uk) seasons (us) to watch so i can guarantee you'll find something. stories original, scary, beautiful, brilliantly acted and a must watch! rating 10 out of 10\",\"even though some episodes are better than others, all of them are a masterpiece! a very unique show which i definitely recommend for older teenagers and adults. almost every episode has some sort of twist or an ending that absolutely blows you away! i've heard of black mirror several times in the past but never attempted to watch it because the anthropology component didn't interest me and i had never watched an anthropology before. but now that i've watched it i would do anything to watch this magnificent show for the first time. so to anybody reading this, i beg you to give black mirror a chance.\",\"far away from black mirror, this \\\"thing\\\" or better this piece of series-crap, will waste your time. the short stories are absolutly bad told. the animation and cgi effects are full of mistakes and cause eye cancer.violence, sex and satanism are the main messages. don't expect social criticism or visions of the future. all episodes were a bunch of crap as i said. there is nothing else but disgusting violence and sex.please manage your money wise. don't invest in such crap-productions.\",\"remember that sick twisted feeling you get after watching one of these episodes? weird right? so skip season 5. cool ideas, ok tv but horribly written and put together. i don't call season 5 black mirror. it's dumb and just not as gripping as most other seasons. like remember shut up and dance? or hang the dj? season 5 is not even close to those episodes. watch it if you please but lower your expectations.\",\"if you usually like sci_fi and thriller show. so no doubt this series for you. in that series you'll watch newly concept on science fiction. each episode is deferent to other episode so don't be confuse. black mirror one of the finest sci_fi series i have ever see.\",\"black mirror animation.at least as successful as \\\"black mirror\\\", interesting and very beautiful series. i started on the advice of a friend and i loved it, and you will too.\",\"this is basically a darker, more gritty black mirror animation and it is perfect in so many ways.\",\"personally, i cannot recommend the early seasons of black mirror enough. they were a revelation, offering genius and thought-provoking content that left a lasting impact on me. the show's ability to delve into the dark side of technology and society was unparalleled, making each episode a haunting and unsettling experience.however, as an avid viewer, i was left deeply disappointed when the show started to lose its original roots. the transition to american production seemed to dilute the essence of what made black mirror so special. the distinct british touch, which brought a unique charm and social commentary to the stories, began to fade away.the later episodes, influenced by the americanized approach, felt less daring and more formulaic. the narratives became predictable, and the shocking twists and turns that once defined the series became scarce. it seemed as if black mirror had succumbed to the pressures of appealing to a broader audience, sacrificing its artistic integrity in the process.while i acknowledge that art and creative decisions are subjective, for me, the magic of black mirror started to fade as it strayed further from its original brilliance. the show's earlier seasons remain a testament to its ability to provoke thought, challenge societal norms, and ignite conversations about the perils of technology.in conclusion, i highly recommend indulging in the first seasons of black mirror, savoring their genius and thought-provoking narratives. however, i must caution against expecting the same level of impact as the series progresses. as it veers into a more americanized territory, it loses the spark that made it a groundbreaking and captivating experience..\",\"the show is amazing. seasons 1-5 were really amazing, such creativity and an open-minded team. season 6 really just said f it, ruin everything. from having a bad perspective about future tehnologies in 1-5 to having to watch a woman driving a car in the 80's in season 6. i am really dissapointed netflix. anyway, ep 1 from season 6 was hmm ok. the rest is just awful.it was really obvious the should have continued the same style of content i dont know why they changed something so easy to observe. i hope they will change it back maybe in sez 7 if it is happening but these are just speculations.\",\"i've been a longtime fan of black mirror. it had always felt like a modern twilight zone with a focus on the potential downsides of future technologies. with season 6 it feels like they threw the premise out the window and went with an anything goes approach to storytelling, including the supernatural. in addition, the overall quality of the writing has declined in seasons 5 and 6. the first 4 seasons of the show is among my favorite tv shows ever, but they seem to have mostly lost their touch.it's not that the most recent seasons are irredeemable because there are some pretty good episodes, but they are nowhere near the high bar that was set by the early seasons. don't believe me? go watch from the beginning and it will become obvious how much the show has changed. none of the newer episodes are remotely close to the quality of \\\"the entire history of you\\\", \\\"white bear\\\", and \\\"white christmas.\\\" even the weaker episodes of seasons 1-4 are significantly better than most of seasons 5 and 6.i suppose it's nice to get some new episodes of black mirror even if it isn't what it used to be, but i was hoping for much better. despite my misgivings about the last two seasons, i hope there ends up being a season 7 because i am a big fan of the anthology series format. overall, i still think the show deserves a solid 8 when considering the entirety of the series to this point.\",\"this was an amazing surprise, totally random,didn't see any advertising for it.every episode, unique, interesting, beautifully animated.a little black mirror feel to it, but every idea is flawlessly pulled off.would recommend anyone to check this out, you will be hooked after the first episode.\",\"so while seasons 1 to 5 have been punchy, and captivating from the first to last second, season 6 is suffering from netflix disease i.e. pad it out with narrative filler to get it out to 40 min (the longer you keep us watching, the less we are watching your streaming competitors).so all but ep2 has dragged from the start, and could have got to the not too bad endings within 20min.get the original uk writers in again and try a reboot. short, sharp and punchy once more. perhaps we'll get a few more episodes per season too.please, please save this awesome show by giving it back to the brits!\",\"presaumably a bunch of 13 years olds watched a load of black mirror episodes and decided, \\\"we can do that, but let's animate it instead so we can go really over the top with it so hopefully nobody will notice there is zero substance to it\\\".first episode is actually not too terrible but the series goes steeply downhill after that. be prepared for a lot of \\\"and then he woke up & realised it was all a dream,\\\" type endings, with plenty of clichés & terrible dialogue filling in the gaps.maybe some kind of tom hanks \\\"big\\\" scenario actually happened in real life & the person in charge of commissioning at netflix was actually a 13 year old in an adult's body at the time this got signed up?\",\"the animations are just awesome........ netflix comes out with something fabulous all the time! just like black mirror no two episodes are inter linked or have any continuity with each other.\\ngore scenes and nudity are sort of a given, and due to it's very short duration (7-14 minutes max) every episode feels like a movie climax scene.....\\nfew episodes weren't actually as good as others but from 10th episode it went crazy\\nliterally loved it...\\nbinge watch it (recommended)\\ni would give this a rating of 8.5\\u002f10\",\"this show is a show where the episodes are independent from each other, but share the same deeper meaning. the name \\\"black mirror\\\" comes from the black screen you have on tv's, computers and phones. every episode, or call it short film, is extremely thrilling and gripping. they are all very intelligent written, and you will be left with a wow-feeling after each episode. it's hard to understand the feeling unless you have seen for yourself!\",\"a perfect example how mixed a series can be.\\nblack mirror is a series about how technology will change our future. every episode is independent and from a different director.i recommend watching season one, two and four, but not season three and five.the first two seasons where the good starting of the producers, but when netflix bought the series, there came season three. and that season was ... just bad. the story's where very bad.then netflix made season four and that one is my favorite. the following season five was not good. not as bad as season three but not really worth to watch.\",\"so sad when you see a good series lose sight of the big picture and what it began as. each season drifts further and further away from the general idea which black mirror presented. season 6 is by far the worst. since when did black mirror turn into \\\"true blood\\\", vampire diaries, van helsing. this \\\"twilight\\\" looking garbage is something that should have never hit the screens, rather a brick wall. having in mind the existence of technologies such as chatgpt, dall-e, etc you would have had a better outcome using them instead of hiring teenagers, giving them beer (as if you can call what you have there beer), locking them in a room with a spinner and expecting magic.\",\"black mirror has always been one of my favourite shows. it is completely different from everything else. it has been fresh, quirky and gripping in every respect. every episode has been different and has transfixed me. it is now described as a netflix original. it was on u. k tv years before it got to netflix.i have been anxiously awaiting the release of season 6 which i've just binge watched over a couple of days.i was quite disappointed in season 6 with some episodes having a familiar ring to them where i've seen very similar themes before, even in previous episodes.the best episode of season 6 from my perspective was episode 2 loch henry which was scary, original and brilliantly acted. overall i found season 6 patchy and disappointing.\",\"i have to say that i am a fan of the genre, and i would love to see more animation movies out there but i would never ever imagined to see such a masterpiece of a series on netflix.\\nthe quality of the animations, the richness of the lore, the amazing plot twist and the variety of genre made every episode a unique adventure in a different reality.\\nit could be very violent in some parts, but is because this series has no filter and i'm completely happy with that.\\nthe only negative side is the duration of each episodes and especially for some of just 6-8 minutes is not enough to completely enjoy them, and the sadness for being separated from that story is a lot.\\nalso some stories are not that great but the astonishing quality compensate for it.this series is in another league together with black mirror. and i hope netflix will do a lot of seasons because these masterpiece are never enough (and i hope to see more from some episodes).\",\"if you really love series like black mirror, then this is the one for you. keeps you at the edge of the seat just with 10-15 minute stories.\\nthe best part about the series is the making and editing of each episode which is just spectacular in every way. the violence really terrifies you sometimes.\\nbut hey.. don't expect to see the typical movie elements like - introduction of characters followed by story elevation and then finally a climax. you don't see all of that in here.. just enjoy those 10-15 minutes without looking for meaning.. the best episode for me is \\\"sonnie's edge\\\". looking forward to see a few more episodes.\",\"typically not my style but was swayed by the good reviews. was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the change of pace. some episodes are meh, but on the whole, was solid.was a mix between black mirror, video game cut scenes, and a series of moral lessons.\",\"season 1-4 are amazing. i rated 10\\u002f10 for all. but season 5, there's no black mirror elements in all 3 episodes. i was so excited and started on 5th june itself.all 3 are very average stories, the 2nd and 3rd episode is very predictable and 1st one has a small twist that too not that imapct full.\\noverall season 5 left no mark at all. one can give it skip.\",\"my favorite tv show of all time. it's a series of science-fiction anthologies focusing on potential ugly outcomes of technology innovation, and many of them are already about to happen. episodes are standalone with their own original story, but they all share the main theme of how technology might affect us and reveal the hideous side of our soul. furthermore, their typical dark and ironic tone are so exceptional, it blends in perfectly with the main theme. besides, the anthology approach was really a great choice because it keeps the audience focused on core concept of the series while enjoying various stories rather than be attached to some recurrent characters in a standard approach. indeed, the show has never ceased to amaze us, either with unimaginable ideas of technology, or sometime with new plot development regarding similar tech innovations but from very different angles. like its creator - charlie brooker said: \\\"there was a signature tone to the stories, the same dark chocolate coating - but the filling was always a surprise.\\\" and all together, that's what has made black mirror stand out as an uniquely remarkable picture of our time.\\n* the series's title was inspired by the cold, shiny screen of a tv, a monitors, a smart-phone... when it's off - technology's \\\"black mirror\\\" that can reflect the darkness of humanity.* some of you might decide to abandon the series after watching the 1st episode. that's a terrible mistake! in fact, i consider it as one of the weakest stories of the collection. in my opinion, as it was a pilot, brooker didn't want to go too deep, therefore the shocking stayed in the shallow but not in the profound. however, don't give up on the show because of it! otherwise you'll miss some extraordinary gem that'll make you regret.\\nso far, my 3 favorite stories are: 3rd - \\\"the entire history of you\\\" (season 1); 2nd - \\\"black museum\\\" (season 4); and especially the 2014 christmas special, \\\"white christmas\\\", has been my number one ever since.\",\"because \\\"black mirror\\\" is an anthology series, it is, by nature, uneven. that said, there are more good episodes than bad. there is not a single episode that doesn't make you think. this series has some of the best episodes i have ever seen on tv. some will make you uncomfortable, others are more upbeat, but none disappoint. i have my favorites, but will just say to watch the entire series.\",\"not all the episodes of black mirror are great but there is a decent variety of them... ironically blue bear associates with trump and david cameron does like bacon... the show touched a lot of interesting subjects, but some of the best ideas were taken from other shows not widely known to major public and popular culture... the whole concept of consciousness transfers, comes from bsg\\u002f caprica, especially from caprica, a show not many now and not many heard about... so if you like the whole idea of storing consciousness on other devices or inside robots, transferring them to other virtual worlds and so on and so on, check out caprica... nevertheless \\\"uss callister was my favourite episode and as much as i love it it's a dark star trek which should have had his own spin off...\",\"as a fervent fan eagerly awaiting the sixth season of black mirror on netflix, i had high hopes for another mind-bending and thought-provoking journey into the world of twisted technology. however, my experience left me with mixed feelings. while there was one standout episode titled \\\"joan is awful\\\" that showcased brilliant performances by selma and annie, the remaining episodes fell short of expectations. i found them to be boring, slow-paced, and with underwhelming plots.the season had its moments of brilliance, particularly with the exceptional performances by selma and annie in \\\"joan is awful.\\\" however, the overall lackluster episodes prevented the season from reaching its full potential.taking my overall viewing experience into account, i would give the entire sixth season of black mirror a rating of 5 out of 10. while it had its highlights, the season as a whole failed to deliver the same level of captivating storytelling that fans have come to expect.it's important to remember that personal opinions may differ, and while i may have found some episodes lacking, others might have resonated with different viewers. although i was disappointed with this particular season, i remain hopeful that future installments of black mirror will recapture the brilliance that made the series so popular.\",\"never had a television show keep me invested as much as black mirror has. truly captivating and terrifying warning of our soon-to-be future. i love how charlie brooker uses a positive and negative light on the topic of tech in the show. the episode \\\"san junipero\\\" shows how amazing and beautiful technology can be. episodes like \\\"playtest\\\" and \\\"metalhead\\\", however, show how dangerous and terrifying technology can be. season six is even better!! don't trust season 6's bad reviews. seeing brooker take a entire different route in the horror genre was so refreshing to see, and it was done perfectly! my favorites were \\\"loch henry\\\" and \\\"beyond the sea\\\" they were true horror situations.please, take some time out of your day and watch this amazing masterpiece of twists, turns, and horror!\",\"not sure how any of these episodes checked off the boxes qualifying them to be labeled black mirror. they were watchable but nothing as i have come to expect from the series.the first episode, joan is awful was the only one that might belong in the franchise. the episode beyond the sea was the lone shining star for me. there was enough there that i could see it potentially as a pretty interestiing movie on its own. the remaining episodes were just c-minus fillers.i miss the previous bm seasons that made you stop in your tracks for 2 seconds and question if this could be possible? season 6 was something but not bm.\",\"season 1 of britain's \\\"black mirror\\\" (2011) was absolutely terrific. (to be clear, this first \\\"season\\\" consists of only three episodes, although subsequent seasons have more.) this looks to be a truly superb dystopian science fiction anthology series — i'd rate it a 9 out of 10.i'd point to two qualities that make this show stellar. first, it's truly smart stuff. the story devices are thoughtfully invented and quite original. (these are \\\"near-future\\\" -type sci-fi tales depicting how new technology or cultural trends can have unforeseen consequences.) this show doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence, it relies on him or her to pay attention and think.second, the writers here have a firm grasp of genuine psychological horror. there are no radioactive monsters in the sewers here, or killer robots from the future — but \\\"black mirror\\\" manages to be scary without those things. it does just fine presenting the viewer with visions of human shame, fear, jealousy or existential loss. these are stories that deal primarily with the psychology of their characters — and they truly get under your skin.this is great stuff — i'd recommend it.\",\"as someone that had heard of the show but it being a netflix show with great 'critical acclaim', i, like i'm sure many, decided to give it a miss. last night while bored i decided to give it a go and to be fair it isn't all bad!for one, the animation throughout the majority of the episodes is great! there are some not so great ones and others that look like you're being told what to do as a next mission on a capcom game but generally really good and worthy of an 8 star.sadly everything else is weaker.a few scripts in each season throughout the 3 so far were great, but, they were few and far between. some of them felt like a 15 year old who had seen black mirror a few times writing something they think a 12 year old would like.along with that a lot of the voice acting was beyond bad! i wouldn't even use 'called it in' because maybe if they had used a phone they may have sounded less wooden.lastly as one who couldn't care less about nudity or swearing it was odd to me that netflix would do so much in one show, almost as if they wanted some controversy to boost ratings..??anyway, i diverge. the animation is mostly great, the stories are more miss than hit and the voice acting is generally not good but passable. overall i think a 7\\u002f10 is a very fair.\",\"didn't care for the first 3 episodes but it gets better with episodes 4, 5 and 6. i give the whole season a 6 minus.episode 1 is about social media. i absolutely hated it. community did way better with a lot more satire in the 8th episode \\\"app development and condiments\\\" of season 5. episode 2 didn't feel like a black mirror episode and the lead is so annoying it's painful to watch.episode 3 is not subversive, not new and pretty boring then things start to get better with episode 4 and finished grandiosely with features length episode 5. tl;dr : skip episode 1-3 and watch'em letter if you get bored.\",\"now don't get me wrong black mirror is amazing. it shows possibilities of inventions and anti-utopias in the future and some are happening today. but season 5 feels to americanised and just crappy. the only decent episode in season 5 is smithereens. but then you have the other two. the ashley o one is just crap. and striking vipers is ok. the whole idea of black mirror is the abuse of technology and how it effects people. but i feel like after season 4 it's just gone down. for my advice watch all the way through season 1-4 because mostly all of them are good with some off them which are ok but still are good concepts. and in season 5 just watch smithereens and maybe striking vipers don't watch the ashley o episode. otherwise except from them episodes the series is really good and i would recommend it.\",\"what else is there to say. five seasons of intense stories, some great, some weird, some not so good. but all on the edge of the seat, edge of the mind. very intense stuff. now season 6 goes full gore and horror. boring all of the episodes really, way too long taking 2 hours to deliver a 20 minute story. annoying some episodes, and disturbing only for the needles purposeless violence. i was a bit on the edge to turn on the season, as i can't say most of season 1-5 was particularly easy to digest, and i really felt like i want to be mentally prepared to take it in. instead a mix of boring horror. whoever is the one directing the content, take a look in the mirror.\",\"what on earth i've just watched! this is definitely not black mirror. we can give a slight chance to episode 3, other than that nope! i mean the stories are below average and the directors ruined the whole series and shattered the reputation of the holy til now black mirror.it seems i should write more, ok i can elaborate; where is the original spirit? you can call it horror series for children, maybe! again, if you take out the third episode, the whole season will be unwatchable. netflix thought they will ditch the crisis if they allow self-critic. i hate the company more now after this s*** show, literally, s*** show!\",\"charllie brooker's series 'black mirror', just having released its 6 episode fourth season on netflix, is must-see story-telling for the current developing age of homo technologus, where feeble humans cope with what their age of apps and smartphones have wrought and are wreaking.\\neach story can be considered on its own. here is a tale of a husband paging through the memory chip in his head that augments his ability to recall events and discovering a new view of his wife. there is a tale of what can happen when an electronic bee-hive is hacked. all are tales of the near future so close we are almost touching it.\\nwe can agree or disagree with how the writer sees the issues, but i think the issues are already there.\\nthere is plenty of homage to go around to the best of sci-fi prognositicators, i would mention the creator of twilight zone, rod serling, and i would mention philip k. dick as a mentor as well. but charlie brooker works them into the perceptions of now.\",\"black mirror is clearly the best attempt to cyberpunk i've seen in years and if it wasn't for not having watched much television, i wouldn't believed i actualy missed out on it for so long. maybe it's not actualy classified as cyberpunk. it's something different as if we needed a new genre to place this social and technological fiction that isn't so far off from what we already experience in the so-called \\\"first world\\\", or at least in most episodes. each episode is an hour long and written by different people which makes the two season of the series, with three episodes each very diverse so far. there's also a christmas special and a third one coming out of netflix. it deals with the overabundance of conectivity and communication technologies in our lives, but isn't so far off from the present. except having a 4-g or 5-g cellphone tracking your everymove seems acceptable while having it inside of your arm, or your eyes, or behind your ears seems different. it's those tiny differences that are making the stories of black mirror, but the real ones that are at stake in the criticism. and suddently you understand better why the techies wearing google glasses were getting a beat up when first introduced, or why there are signs baring entry to cyborgs and cameras to the social centers & infoshops. that's what science-fiction does best : changing little things to turn it into fiction, so that we're detached enough to finally understand our surroundings. i hope the netflix produced version is going to stay as critical but somehow doubt it.\",\"i don't think i've ever seen a show fall off a cliff like this one. season 1 and 2 were absolutely incredible and even season 3 was pretty good but slowly the show started to degrade. i still recommend everyone watch the early seasons and if you are brave enough to continue into the later seasons, that's your prerogative but be ready to be disappointed. season 6 is absolutely awful. so bad, in fact that i can't imagine wanting to watch whatever trash they come up with for season 7\\nthe writing and acting in season 6 are atrocious. the writing is lazy and intelligent. some of the episodes could pass for high school writers. the early seasons were well thought out and often had a poingant message that often left me thinking for days. this newer stuff is utter garbage with the viewer being bludgeoned by the message at every turn. subtlety and good story telling have been replaced. it's so sad to see the creativity of a once bold show get sucked out like this.\",\"i loved this show but and theres always a but. i was not keen on the new season 6 and very disappointed. it was more horror, drama and less sci-fi. black mirror is all about the sci-fi. this new season just didn't work for me. the stories were nothing new and done a hundred times before. its such a huge shame as this was a good show. the last seasons gives us a glimpse into the very near future on what could happen with tech, a. i and social media network. if they ever do another season, hopefully they return to the sci-fi which blew our minds back in the day. we can only hope and see what the future holds for black mirror. let's hope they go back to the sci-fi we all love.\",\"black mirror has always been able to extrapolate a dark future based on the most pressing current threats. this season took extreme loneliness, unprocessed grief, dissociations, schizophrenia, etc. & dramatized them into literal depictions. i certainly miss the sci-fi dystopian storytelling aspects, but arguably, much of that has already materialized in reality (ai is here in all its black mirror glory). so, i think they focused on the most human threat we face now, mental health crisis, and i'm all for it!it may seem like a detour from previous seasons, but once you appreciate the nuances of the underlying metaphors, it's pretty badass. black mirror reflects how the world has become a desensitized ecosystem lacking compassion, driven by success, fame, or money, most times out of sheer survival necessity. that empathy-seeking grief is driving many \\\"corruptible\\\" minds into dark, irreversible actions, especially in the scarcity of healing resources.it shifts from its usual narrative but truly reflects our dark society. also, the few throwbacks were pretty cool!\",\"first of all, if you browsing for a show to watch, look no more and go with black mirror ( im surprised that you havent allready). but i found it myself by accident, looking for a good show to chill. and man, was i hooked from the 1st 5 mins.\\nits really good show, each episode will surprise with the meh moment again and again. every time i found myself wondering about the episode i watched, days after.\",\"i have watched the whole series and it was something which i never seen, even i did not have any thoughts of them. the whole series is based on a human society where science is very much advanced. the government said that it was all for human well fair. governments always manipulated normal civilian thoughts in case if they become rebels and will be treats for them. in our sleeping cells we disabled our thinking that scientific advancements also have their drawbacks. team black mirror conveyed this message to all it's viewers that nobody should manipulate or bend the laws of nature. because if this law is tampered by science, then the whole humanity must be prepared for it's fatal consequences.\",\"if you haven't watched black mirror yet... well you definitely should! black mirror is a series full of action. every episode in this netflix series pulls you into a whole new world you've never seen before. every episode is very distinct from each other, each episode has a lesson that reflects to our lies today and the scenes are incredibly clever and creative the futuristic technology creates scenes that will have you hooked! these episodes aren't only incredibly designed but the main idea to every episode id so unique... something you could never image yourself. this series has you predicting the ending throughout the whole episode. though they can be rather confusing at first, they only make for an even more eventful ending. my personal favorite episode is nosedive! i was clever and eye opening...i loved it! this series is freaking awesome! it won't disappoint, i promise!\",\"they say ''ignorance is a bliss'', what if we show you what you have ignored? this is basically the theme of black mirror, it describes the bitter truth of life. i promise you...if this show doesn't make you depressed, then i don't know what else will do.\",\"black mirror has been for me one of the highlights in drama over the last decade. imaginative, dark, bleak, often cynical, but always absorbing, incredible viewing. what i wouldn't give to sit down and talk with charlie brooker, to find out where his ideas come from, and what plans he has for the future of the show. the more bleak they are, the more i tend to enjoy them, and the more an episode has that feeling of 'well that could really happen,' the more i love them still. i will admit i feared when the channel four arrangement ended, the americanisation of the show did worry me a lot, but how wrong was i. the show has definitely changed, and improved for my money, episodes like playtest and metalhead are downright scary, while episodes like hang the dj and san junipero tug at the heart strings. how on earth do you pick a favourite episode, so many outstanding contenders, a few of the best include white christmas and san junipero, but the variety is so rich everybody will have a different favourite. i can't wait to see more in the future, please charlie :-)\",\"when i first heard about \\\"black mirror\\\", i learned that each episode was its own story. having now watched the first two seasons - i'm currently on the third - i can say that the connection is technology. how will technology evolve and what will we use it for, given how we now do things?it's one of the most impressive and disturbing shows. the technology evolution is less of an orwell thing than a \\\"2001\\\" thing: the technology gets too smart for us. we invented so many things to convenience ourselves, but it eventually grew more powerful than us, and came to dominate the world.all in all, this is like few things that you've ever seen. definitely check it out.\",\"black mirror is a british tv show that shows the darkest aspects of life and technology. each episode is a different story, but they all have one thing in common: make you think about how technology\\u002flife\\u002fhuman beings can be terrifying. it's kind off a sci- fi\\u002fdrama\\u002fthriller show that really messes with you and i believe it changes you. you'll not forget it soon.the first episode was so disturbing, i can't even describe how shocked i was during the whole thing. the rest are also disturbing but not as much as the first one. i think it was a statement: \\\"this is not going to be a easy tv show to watch but we show the truth about cruelty, about how technology can impact our lives and about us, human beings\\\". i watched all the episodes and i can say they are disturbing (in different levels) but they're all very impressive, well executed and we can see how much effort and thought all the directors\\u002fwriters\\u002factors put in each episode.if you watch the first one and just want to quit, give it another chance and watch the third (which i think is one of the best episodes of a tv show i have ever watched). give it a chance and watch the first season, it's only three episodes and, believe me, it's worth it.\",\"those who are fans of black mirror s1-s5 and literally worshiped those episodes and patiently waited for s6 know exactly what i'm talking about. if you're new, don't start with that last season. it doesn't do previous seasons any justice. start with season 1 and stop after last episode of season 5.season 6 is so bad and lame it's a joke.not just that actors are bad (they've put selma hayek in one episode and on the promo image as a clickbait and that's the only episode watchable and actually contains psychological effects), other episodes stories are off and not ,,black mirrory,, at all. it's like producers made them in a hurry with no passion or regards to the black mirror concept.so disappointing. just enjoy s1-s5 and stop right there.\",\"i've not yet watched all available episodes of black mirror, but my impression so far is that this is completely unlike any other series (anthology or otherwise) i've seen. the stories are diverse and seem to come out of left field, which is brilliant in its own right. they do share a common theme, however - examining the darker side of technology and how it's come to dominate our lives for better or worse.can't really say much more without spoiling it but one doesn't need to be a science fiction\\u002ffantasy fan to truly appreciate this show. it's got a powerful message and will, in my opinion, inspire viewers to contemplate some of the larger questions facing the human race. the drama and acting are uncommonly good to excellent; the pacing taut and intense. it's an enjoyable experience as much as it can be an uncomfortable one, but the discomfort is a good thing; after all, how many t.v. shows truly make us use our brains these days?\",\"black mirror was superb , each episodes are wonderful , and it keeps curiosity till the end , and every episodes are better than another episodes , whole seasons like just wow !!!\",\"my choice for the film review is black mirror - british science fiction anthology television series created by charlie brooker where the series are not related to each other by plot, actors, time or place of narration. according to brooker, all the subjects unite only satire on the way of life that is prevalent in the modern society. the cross - cutting theme is the influence of information technology on human relations. the series shows the modern life of mankind and all the problems that technological innovations bring to people's lives. in each series, people can recognize themselves. black mirror shows the world where technology burst into human life and took a solid place. without computers, tvs, laptops, phone and other electronic devices people cannot imagine their lives. this kind of technique is called the \\\"black mirror\\\" of mankind. the world wide web has captured the billions people in its networks. social networks swallowed the youth up. and it has already reached the point close to the situation where people cannot see the difference between reality and virtuality. during watching black mirror, person will see a realistic picture of the modern world, where people are ruled by technology. in order to clearly show the world with its own norms which is shown in black mirror, i will provide as an example one of the episodes of this serial which is called \\\"nosedive\\\" - series 3, episode 1, where the whole life revolves around the rating in the social networks. high rating gives you a discount on the purchase of the real estate, luxury seats in an airplane, and the possibility of rapid career growth. the rating defines to which social class person belongs to; the higher ratings person has the more respect, kindness and privilege he receives. but the issue is that people in that world are ready to go on with a strained smile and fake feelings all their lives and forget about sincerity only in order to make their ratings to be on the top. if draw the parallel between our world and the world, represented in the episode \\\"nosedive\\\", it will be obvious that there is a huge difference in the ways of living. in these two different worlds people have different concepts of norms of behavior; what is normal for \\\"nosedive\\\" world, it is abnormal for our world. for example, if we make friends for the reason that we love them and enjoy the time spent with them, in the world from the series people are communicating with you only because someone has the high ratings in the social network. the significance of the ratings in the social network is so high, that the world became feigned in all senses. these kinds of norms which are being followed by the world from the \\\"nosedive\\\" episode are abnormal for the world we are living in. norm it is a standard of appropriate behavior, but since different societies have different standards, it can be concluded that they follow different norms which could be abnormal for others but normal for themselves.\",\"black mirror can't be define with words. every episode leave you with a lot of reflections\",\"loved the four previous seasons of black mirror. (tbh, i didn't get all the way through season one episode one, and i would suggest that potential viewers start after this particular episode.) the first four seasons were elevated twilight zone episodes (high praise from me). watched the first two episodes of season five and they were subpar. easy to see the twists. but i will give the rest of the season a try. if you want something well done in the same vein as s5 e2, please watch get out! by oscar winning jordan peele. (can't give enough praise for this film.) but, as i said, i am continuing to watch the rest of the season. (yeah, maybe i should have waited to post after watching the entirety of this season.)\",\"my rating : 10\\u002f10 ♠ masterpiece ♠how can anyone rate black mirror less than 10?! it's one of the most fascinating tv shows ever.favourite episodes : be right back, san junipero, hang the dj, the entire history of you, nosedive and fifteen million merits.bring on season 5!\",\"black mirror is an anthology show where a whole bunch of different stories take place. there's elements of horror, sci-fi, survival and others contained in 4, soon to be 5, seasons of 6 episodes each. each episode is self-contained in that they don't touch on any of the other episodes except in the most superficial way. for example in more than one episode they make reference to \\\"brown suede\\\" as a style of coffee. but there's no specific callbacks to any specific episode. it's more like these all take place within a shared universe.there is a certain amount of darkness to it, after all it's not called \\\"black mirror\\\" for nothing. social commentary is a thing and they use the show to reference this. whether it's our addiction to things like facebook, instagram and how others see us all of these things are spoken of in one way or another. i seriously tell anybody not to binge watch this as easy as it might be for you to do. take the time to think about and digest the information and what the episode was trying to say and give yourself some time before firing up the next one.\",\"why are you wasting time reading reviews? just go watch it. it's brilliant. you may want to skip the first episode as it is very inferior to every other one. on the other hand, they just keep getting better, so you may as well watch it, and keep getting surprised. i just don't want you to see the first one, and think it's not any good. here is what you need to know. this show will make you think. it has some futuristic science fiction very well done (i am a futures studies author, so trust me on this). the name black mirror means that it shows you some very dark aspects about our society. problem is that they are not so far fetched and you will relate to some of them. every episode is unrelated, so that thing i talked earlier about the first one not being very good, is not a problem.\",\"the fourth season of black mirror manages to keeep terrifying its viewers with the similar horrors from the last season. all six stories are interesting and engaging, but some stories might get lost by the end of the episodes. overall, a very well done season.\",\"'black mirror' has been great since day one. yes, there are some less then perfect episodes but as a whole series it's pretty neat all around.dark with some good stories that are not just science fiction but also a look at society as a whole thing. most episodes leave you thinking of certain things and issues long after the credits roll. that's how it should be.this new season is pretty good with two excellent episodes. my only real complaint is that i wish the seasons were longer. but quality over quantity as they say.this is a great series for sci-fi fans and non sci-fi fans alike. something for everyone.\",\"i am sort of expecting one more episode in season 6, where they reveal that the writers were striking and the five first episodes in s6 were written by an ai which was not even given the scripts of the first five seasons, but instead some greedy exec thought he could do without the writers and was just writing prompts. that would redempt the whole season, even though it was not entirely bad, just mostly not delivering what the previous seasons did.seasons 1-5, on the other hand, while varying from episode to episode, as a collection reached such heights that i'll let s6 slide.my personal favourites were hang the dj, san junipero, striking vipers and nosedive, but many others were also good.\",\"absolutely on of the best series i've ever watched. one word: brilliant!\\nlooking forward to seeing more episodes of black mirror!\",\"black mirror was the most interesting show out there the first 4 seasons, then... i dont know what happened but season 5 is an insult, a tragedy. it s*cks big time!!\",\"\\\"black mirror\\\" is an anthological series that, for now, consists of 22 episodes, unequally divided into five irregular seasons. the episodes vary in length, genre, and style and are completely separate short films by different authors. what they have in common is only a general theme - the position in which modern technology puts us and not very optimistic forecasts of its further progress.the \\\"black mirror\\\" is in fact the effect that the screens of our monitors, telephones, and tv have when turned off, and symbolically also a dark reflection of our reality and potentially darker future.8\\u002f10.\",\"..in this second series i was blown away by the sheer technical brilliance of the animation but really disappointed by the stories. with the exception of the fantastic giant episode it was monsters, guns and planets. for series 3 can someone please look to black mirror for some futuristic inspiration..?\",\"what happened to black mirror in season 6 is beyond my comprehension. apparently they abandoned the whole lore as well as the futuristic theme almost completely. now most episodes are just a bunch of regular random short stories involving murder and supernatural elements, what does not resemble the previous seasons in any way. a complete change of bearing to the ultimate loss of hardcore fans of the series. for starters, the season contains only 5 episodes, 3 of them having nothing to do with science fiction or \\\"black mirrors\\\" (what i suppose is an allusion to the screens present on modern devices). i hope netflix realises what went wrong and fixes it in the next seasons. otherwise we might just go watch the \\\"dust\\\" channel on youtube instead.\",\"i loved black mirror. not everything was great, but mostly it was. and i enjoyed it. after seeing some bad episodes i stopped watching. i do not know which season it was.suddenly there was season 6 so i gave it go! the first episode was ok and i had the feeling they need to align the compass a bit to find the perfect spot.but with every episode it turned into dark horrish fairytales, but then with the cliche and lazy writing. the acting and shots are of a high level. the ideas can be great, but the storytelling, the choices. it is just wrong for me.maybe the black mirror is indeed black and the creators cannot see what they are making?so i am putting black mirror on my ignore list. this is not my cup of tea. or i must rewatch the first seasons maybe...\",\"black mirror reflects. thank you netflix for being the source of this discovery. i have watched many episodes more than once and each time i get more out of it. i am not writer and not a critic but only a viewer and i would like to thank the creator (s) for this series. i registered on imdb to write this note. congratulations for san junipero emmy's win. it is beyond deserved! i was so happy when i heard the winning news! san junipero is a story that will stay with me forever. black mirror may be dark for some viewers, but the scripts and scenarios are so close to our present and future reality that it is hard to look away, and often in the most intriguing ways. sorry my english is second to me but you get the point:-) i am looking up for the next season! glad shows like yours exist.truly.\",\"after building a great reputation of being such a creative, scary, funny series it seems charlie brooker either has finally lost his imaginative flare or has lost creative control. i was so looking forward to seeing what season 6 would bring, given the events that have unfolded over the past 4 years. sadly however, season 6 was bitterly disappointing. the story lines seemed rushed, lacking his creepy, exciting spark. it really did feel like someone else had written the episodes entirely and that brooker had lost creative control. i can't say i truly enjoyed a single episode, but rather finished each episode thinking... where that was meh.what happened charlie? why did you beer of track? black mirror is no longer.\",\"i'm utterly bemused by these bad reviews about season 5. season 5 lives up to black mirror standard just as the previous seasons.\",\"to like a movie\\u002fseries i need a cahracter i can pesonalize with. but in black mirror main characters usually do stupid decisions and basic mistakes from psychological point of view. \\ni like the showed technology, but the stories bore me therefore i don't see a difference between fast forwarding used technology and watching whole episodes.\",\"i expected more of the new season.at this point i thought that the stories would unravel more and more, but no. season 6 is as plain as any other random movie that will bore the brains out if me. nothing spectacular, very predictable and i will forget 90% of it in a few days. this is not the quality stories that black mirror used to tell. i watch the series at home, with my husband. it's usually at night and don't appreciate the times i had to switch the contrast of my tv or turn the volume down because suddenly a scene where a giant flashlight is burning my eyeballs. or when the characters murmur almost the entire episode and they suddenly decide to blast annoying music. this is ridiculous, doesn't anyone even check if these things are comfortable to watch!?i think this might be an effect that was looked for, to annoy and create an atmosphere, instead of actually writing an interesting plot and i highly dislike it. yet, we already have open ai guys, come on... i don't think it's that impossible to continue the series in an original and innovative manner. i don't care if another season is coming up and i won't watch it.. this is another thing that just got down hard.\",\"review for season 5only three episodes for season 5, makes me wonder if they blew most of their budget so they could get those big name stars. each episode is more than an hour each, though, so watching the season is like watching a long 3-part movie.the first one, \\\"striking vipers\\\" was basically \\\"brokeback mountain\\\" with black people, plus another twist. it showed how much worst catfishing will be as technology improves.the next one \\\"smithereens\\\" was a mystery-tragedy, with the mystery being the why a guy had to kidnap an employee of a social media company, with the tragedy when we finally learned the reason why.the last one, \\\"rachel, jack and ashley too\\\" was sort of an adventure thriller which also gave us a peek on how technology could affect the entertainment industry in the future.in fairness, all the big name stars like anthony mackie, topher grace and miley cyrus did great in their episodes, and probably well worth their talent fees. a solid season, wished there were more episodes, though.\",\"black mirror shows a world where technology is dominant. each episode is a unique thriller with the capacity to send chills down the spine which leaves us in a state of thinking and analyzing about the concept they portrayed in it. every episode is perfect in its own way of depicting the darker side of technology and human nature. it is the darkest series that depicts the events that may happen in the near future. it shows the problems and dangers that come with the advancement of technology through which anyone can do almost anything\",\"after an awful season five, it took me awhile to watch all of the episodes in the latest season of black mirror. the trailers for each episode didn't really excite me. and some of the low ratings made me reluctant to find the time to sit down and watch the new season.but i thought no season of black mirror would ever match or even exceed season four: arkangel, crocodile, uss callister, hang the dj, metalhead, black museum. every episode of that season was absolutely brilliant.but season 6: joan is awful, loch henry, mazey day, demon 79, and beyond the sea far exceeded my expectations. every episode was like watching an individual movie. simply amazing!and i like the inclusion of the red mirror variant (demon 79). but i still don't understand why mazey day wasn't also considered a red mirror movie.\",\"i loved the first 5 seasons of black mirror and was waiting eagerly to watch season 6 only to be disappointed.i somewhat enjoyed episode1, but it was lacking something and for a bm episode i was overall disappointed.episode 2 again was somewhat enjoyable but as a bm episode i was expecting a whole lot more.episode 3 was interesting but again fell short of exciting.episode 4 was plain boring despite me loving the actress zazie beetz.episode 5 was the one i enjoyed the most. it transported me back to early 70's northern england, the music was great, the storyline was enjoyable but again, despite being the most enjoyable episode for me it was still lacking whatever magic black mirror usually gives.pretty forgettable season to be honest. i will always love black mirror season 3 episode 3 (shut up and dance) because of the actor alex lawther who is always a treasure to watch, but after the disappointment of the latest season i thing it's time for the show to end.....unless of course they find their way back to what made the first 5 seasons good..\",\"people talks a lot about black mirror here and there so i gave it a try. i watched this series with expectations of some mine bending stories but i was disappointed to see only

going to watch with high expectations then give it some time to adjust according to your expectations and you would probably don't like first season then.\\nfor me 4th season is the best one in entire

as good when compared to the others, most of them are fantastic. this show gets compared to the twilight zone a lot and while it's a pretty good comparison, i think black mirror is actually a lot

seasons, love them, then move on. covid has yet killed another awesome show. like most films after covid, we suddenly have been left in a predictable world without much controversy. dare we be

about the plot, but the first episode is all that is worth to see black mirror. i just hope that the third episode will bring back that good feeling as it was at the start.i could not find much of information about the show, nor there are many of reviews there, nor ratings here on imdb, but if i could conclude something about this series from first episode, it is the great critique on today's

it's heart \\\"black mirror\\\" is a scifi show using elements of reality and fiction to create believable worlds and characters. if an episode is not pushing the boundaries of ethics and morality: it

a british audience but if you stick it out until season 3 the storytelling broadens to include a more predominant american presence to it's characters and storytelling.my only criticism of the show is

seasons and i recommended this movie to everyone around me. season 6 however is full of blood, violence, murders, murders, murders and again murders. it was dissappointing and it's not only my opinion.it feels like they changed the writers and those writers are horror movie writers. sorry, but i don't recommend season 6 to anyone. it feels like i lost my time watching all season 6' episodes.if you don't have inspiration anymore, stop the movie.i recommend the seasons 1-5, there are some episodes that i will never forget, best science fiction series i watched until now. thank you.\",\"like good science fiction does, black mirror showed us a view of our future. a future of great technological advancement, but with diminished purpose and meaning. right out of the gate, bm was brilliant and daring. it might have been the first television show that warned us of the dangers of modern technology.the problem is now, that the technology that bm predicted has basically come true and passed bm by. so season 6 really has nothing new to say, and what's more the stories it tells are pretty boring. i was not thrilled with season 5. i felt the showing was getting too cute, and that it had lost its edge. so 4 years later, season 6 finally arrived, and it's just not good at all. i was so curious, that i immediately watched episodes from season 1-2, and yes our memory is correct, the show used to be brilliant and innovative. season 6 feels like the cw has tried to do a copy of black mirror.my only hope is that in the last 4 years, booker has written some film scripts or has another show in the works, because bm seems like it is over.\",\"black mirror it's an english series absolutely actual, it's mostly a drama\\u002fsci-fi series and it's centered on the current or future problems of the western society. it's already on the third season but you have to consider that every episode it's a movie completely different between each other and without a common script. but every single episode it's able to bring you in that word and environment, every single episode is well written and well directed and the cast works great. it's one of the best series of the last years due this uniqueness. since is treating and telling story and problems about the actual or near future society and the dark side of technology you have to consider that every single episode is a reflection and meditation starting point that most of the time can let the viewer with a sad sensation or let with a bitter taste. absolutely a must to watch\",\"black mirror is an anthology, meaning it is complied of different sci fi tales to make their seasons. this means the series doesn't really have any synopsis i can say, the only thing i can say is just watch the bloody show already. every episode is different, some horror, some romance, some drama, and if you don't like the episode then just skip it, it's not like you'll miss anything as the next episode on your binge watch will be the complete opposite of what you just watched. as far as acting goes, it's top notch, stars like jon hamm, daniel kaluuya also appear on episodes bringing their amazing performances to the table. every episode has their own cinematography, some bright and colorful, one episode will be black and white, really adding in on the unique feel of the whole thing. i would definitely call this show a masterpiece, but i almost gave it a 9 because of the 5th series. 2 episodes from the fifth series were pretty sh*te. smithereens was great, so was andrew scott's performance. so yes, a masterpiece still, i won't let 2 bad episodes change that especially when compared to the works of art that the previous series had to offer. so ignore season 5 apart from smithereens, smithereens had a very important message and was a wonderfully shot and acted tale. think of it as a mix of mini films. now there may be some things that you may not find good, but there's always an episode for you. there 's twists, laughs, scares all in hour long episodes and tied up in a neat little bow just for you. and the christmas special was stunning, don't forget to watch that. but if that isn't enough, they have their own interactive film, bandersnatch. an. interactive. film. you choose what the main character does, and it is awesome. so please, if you have the time, try watching this, you will not be disappointed.\\nverdict: with something new every episode, black mirror really gets to you, and in all the right ways. a+\",\"paradoxes of digital age affect us daily, although we may not know it or don't want to admit it. the black mirror reflects these paradoxes and possible dangers in an understandable, moderate, appealing way, without unnecessary moralizing or going to extremes.ideas from each episode, which last \\\"only\\\" 40-60 minutes, always sticked with me for several days. episodes which aired on netflix are less edgy and more straight to the point than those broadcasted on uk television, but black mirror is definitely one of the best drama shows in past decade.\",\"i loved black mirror from the very first episode when i saw it on channel 4 years ago. the first three seasons were everything i wanted in an edgy sci-fi show, it was satirical and insightful. it had something to say about society and the human condition.then it jumped to netflix and season four was largely ok. not everything worked but some of the episodes were classic black mirror. then came bandersnatch which was good but more of a gimmick than anything else.then came season 5. my god, how the mighty have fallen. i got a sense that these episodes were knocked out quickly as the dialogue was awful, the themes had all been touched on before and there were only three episodes. out of the three only smithereens was any good but, in comparison to earlier episodes, it was only a shadow of what came before.black mirror used to have bite but series 5 just sucks, which is all you can do when you've lost your teeth.\",\"as black mirror is an anthology series, it's better to watch individual episodes rather than binge it, as they don't really connect and watching them in one go can detract from the message. incredibly poignant, sometimes to a fault, yet ultimately engaging storytelling. as the series progresses, it becomes repetitive and monotone, which was bound to happen. however there is no doubt that some episodes in there are some of the most unique and engrossing pieces of television i have seen.\",\"season 7 different than past seasons, but just as good. this season was a love letter to classic sci-fi and horror, and largely a departure from the insightful exploration of technology's societal implications. some fans will fault it for not being \\\"black mirror\\\" enough, but charlie brooker (who wrote almost all episodes in all seasons) is still a great writer, and you can see it in season 6 if you are willing to look from a slightly different angle. the same depth, detail, and quality is there, but it's in different places. for example, \\\"beyond the sea\\\" is an homage to classic 1960's sci-fi books and serials, so it's not about the possible impact of 21st century social media. instead it is richly filled with themes and details reminiscent of those writings. similarly, some episodes are more horror than sci-fi, but written and made with the same talent and high standards we saw in the early seasons of \\\"black mirror\\\". in gratitude for what \\\"black mirror\\\" gave me in previous seasons, i'm

you have a better experience after all.as other reviewers say, not a minute wasted with this show and dont listen to those who say, its a copy of black mirror. it may has some vibes, but thats all.

and interesting. not bad, but a bit of a waste of an opportunity.\",\"i love black mirror. its been one of the best shows on tv since it began. (can we call it tv now?) not every episode is perfect. but its always entertaining and thought provoking. its never lazy or formulaic. its always imaginative and provocative.what i don't understand is that it seems people are quite down on season 5 and i don't get why. sure, i would not say any of them are as good as the very best episodes like san junipero, white christmas, shut up and dance etc. but also i wouldn't say any of them are as bad as the worst.smithereens was the best of the three imo. andrew scott was superb as always. and the story was heart-wrenching. but its the miley cyrus episode that seems to be coming under fire the most. now i'm no miley fan, but i thought she equipped herself well in this and was perfectly cast. one thing people seem to be saying is that this episode 'rachel, jake and ashley too' was cliche and a trite portrayal of the music business. all i would say to that (and i work in the music business), is that those criticisms come from people who have forgotten the idea of a metaphor. yes, if the story was just saying rock is real and pop is contrived then that would be both a lazy cliche and inaccurate. but to assume that you would have to ignore that charlie brooker is never that simplistic and never that lazy as a writer. so think harder, dig deeper and perhaps you will find more than meets the eye. this series is not, never has been nor never will be for lazy viewers.\",\"black mirror, for me, went through a different phase each season. i will use these phases as building blocks to review the series as a whole. start-up: at this point, the series was new, wild, very confronting and, unfortunately, completely unknown to the outside (read: non-bbc) world. everything was right. the creator had an idea and he made it happen on the small screen. in my opinion, the best episodes were created in this season for just that reason. while underrated, the brilliance caused the series to earn a second season. growth: this is when i picked up on the series because it got better and more reviews overall. i really enjoyed every episode except the very first one and i could only hope for more brilliance from the creators. the writing was excellent and the concept was still incredibly cool and unique. maturity: the series achieved its peak with the white christmas episode. the show got a broader fanbase and netflix decided to throw money into the concept to scale it up to six episodes a season. this was the moment i, and with me probably many more, got very excited for the future of the series. however, the new episodes were still enjoyable but every fan knew this was not the rebellious and brilliant series it used to be. it lost its touch with its core, which mostly showed in the unusually happy episode san junipero. don't get me wrong, that episode was brilliant, but not as 'black mirror' as the striking episodes in the beginning (like five million merits) used to be. decline: i watched the fourth season right when it came out, and i let it sink in for a few months before i wanted to write this review. there was not a single episode that got me on the edge of my seat, and there was not a single episode that really got me thinking. what i loved about black mirror was the challenge it gave us to look differently at (all our behavior with) technology. however, this season, more than ever, let the good guys win, had inexplicable and unreasonable plots (instead of technology, it were the people causing bad events) or it was outright not 'black' at all (hang the dj, which i will review separately because of its wasted potential). for me, black mirror has ended. it was great as long as it lasted. but every great concept like this was great because it was what it was at the time: a niche. a niche talking to a specific audience that wants to be challenged. when netflix wants to produce more episodes in a shorter time window, it comes at a cost. the cost of the niche that i valued so much at the beginning of the series. so right now, it is time to find a new niche series to enjoy.\",\"black mirror is not a show for the weak of heart, those fragile in our society, those easily disturbed.black mirror is for those of us who can take on the darker side of life without suffering a nervous breakdown.the very first episode of this show is possibly the most disturbing piece of television i have ever watched. for many i would suggest skipping the first episode and re-visiting it later when you have become a little more hardened to this type of show. most of the one star reviews of this show are from folks totally repulsed by the first episode. it hits them so hard they couldn't cope!every episode of this show sends you a message from the writer. sometimes that message is not welcomed....but it should always make you think!the overall concept of the show is that technology is not a positive improvement in our lives.....the writer occasionally admits that it could be, if used properly (season 3, ep 4), but for the most part we are better off without technology, because it will be abused!this is a show for the thinking person, who has a strong heart! if you don't like to be shocked, don't go anywhere near this show. if you love to have you brain massaged....this is for you!\",\"season 5 may be terrible, but black mirror is a very impressive, original show with lots of interesting ideas.\",\"i think it's pretty much legendary how off putting the 1st episode of black mirror is. i have had so many friends tell me they saw that first episode and didn't watch any more.that's sad because there are some truly great episodes. in particular season 1 episode 3, season 2 episode 4, all of season 3. but much of the rest is so-so to just poor. season 4 was a let down. the first 3 seasons for the most part, every episode was \\\"omg, that really could happen if we aren't careful how we use new tech\\\" but season 4 had none of that. instead it was just kind of like a creepshow-esqe anthology of random tech based horror-ish skits.season 5 had one interesting episode, episode 1, though it had a poor resolution.so, the good episodes are truly great, must watch tv. but the rest drags it down. as such it doesn't deserve the 9\\u002f10s many are giving in imo.\",\"#blackmirror\\nmust see.\\ni loved it until season 4\\nseasons 1-4 are fantastic and a must see. bandersnatch was very interesting. these 4 seasons are on society and human condition.\\non its own, season 5 is watchable. compared to the previous seasons however, it's waste.\",\"seasons 1-4 were brilliant. all unique themes woven into creative stories that unraveled at just the right pace.season 5, not so much. it had nothing to do with the noticeably more mainstream actors; they didn't have much to work with. the writers seemed to rehash technology themes, but didn't work up the sickening sense of dread that we've come to expect of black mirror.without it, the season feels forced and preachy. ultimately, i was bored with season 5. good thing each episode is standalone, otherwise the entire series would be ruined.eta june 2023: after finishing the first episode of season 6, i was super excited because i thought it was black mirror returned to form. unfortunately, the rest of the season is lackluster; the actors turn in great performances, but the storylines were weak and, as another reviewer described it, bloated. it's not as a bad as s5, so my rating doesn't change. still totally worthwhile.\",\"it's just superb. something totally fresh and different, especially since it's a netflix original.\\nthe quality of the animations is top-notch, and each episode brings something unique to the table. it's packed with tension and cool plot

is such a good a show and a definite must watch. every episode is different. i love this show and have loved it since it first came out it's just so upsetting when you wait so long for a new season and there are only 3 episodes!! i just want there to be more. i really reccomed you check out this show!\",\"black mirror has been by far, my favorite series in decades comparable only to the twilight zone and of course, the alfred hitchcock hour. black mirror managed to surpass both for me which is no small feat, combining both sci-fi and mystery with an ongoing theme of strange curiosity that evokes both imagination and emotion. i found myself quite literally on the edge of my seat with each and every episode, ruminating over each episode that graced my screen after watching and anxiously anticipating the next episode - and series - with disappointment and feeling a great void when they were over. this was true with each and every episode from series 1 through series 4. i am still ranking this series as a whole an 8 out of 10 which would have been a strong 10 without reservation had it not been for series 5. now, we reach series 5 and i'm more confused than disappointed. i'll explain...\\nwhile there have been only 3 episodes thus far in the 5th season, they all seem to have an ongoing theme of absurdity. well, almost uselessness. the 1st episode is interesting but way too far-fetched and predictable than remotely possible which is the key element in what creates good mystery and sci-fi in the first place. this episode, it's just silliness. and, if you happen to have strong core values you may want to view this before showing it to your children. even my husband who is a die-hard sci-fi addict found it not only absurd but revolting, just fyi, and we are absolutely open-minded and accepting of alternative lifestyles and views. the second episode is a regurgitated lesson from back in 2010 and is equally predictable. the 3rd episode is definitely sci-fi approved however there was way under zero mystery and was more predictable than the first 2 episodes. i will say though, that the addition of the altered 90's lyrics from 25 years ago was a nice touch. it's as though they shoved charlie brooker (who i admire greatly) into a closet and said \\\"you have 3 days, come up with 3 episode stories.\\\" they're terrible. and, to a certain degree they have all been done before. i won't mention how or where as this would create spoilers. the directing was awful. so, what happened?\",\"almost all episodes make you think further than the script like black mirror but with less limitation due to animation platform!love it! and recommend for those picky viewers like me!!!... 😁\",\"season 6 is nothing like the rest of the other seasons, except episode 1 and 2. the rest were sucky, long cliches. not sure what happened. there was nothing interesting about the werewolf. the beginning was so boring, i kept thinking where's the twist. also there's always some kind of technology story going on. nothing. nothing original in the werewolf episode. then the last episode was worse than any episode of twilight zone. cliche. someone finds a medallion, the world is endings , they must kill people so demon gets wings. so unoriginal it's unbelievable it's a part of black mirror. i would recommend all the seasons and episodes, but only the first 2 episodes in season 6. just be prepared to know that this season is different from other seau in free as.\",\"this is purely for seasons 1-4 and for bandersnatch from season 5.season 5 was boring and silly. season 6 is a mixture of terrible episodes and some quite well done episodes that have nothing whatsoever to do with black mirror.seasons 1 through 4 are masterpieces. some episodes are better than others, like with any anthology series. but the good ones are just next-level, even when you have to suspend disbelief sometimes (full nervous system vr systems the size of an m&m - no, not unless everything else is up to the same level of tech!).it seems that once a series peaks, we just have to accept that that's it, it's done, it will never get up there again. for me the high water marks were crocodile, metalhead and white bear. though i have to say, i still got back and watch the speech from 15 million merits for the thrill of it. it's too good.4 seasons, 1 special - that's pretty good. now we need something of equal calibre!\\\"somebody\\\" removes negative reviews so i hope this one will just sail through.\",\"wow i was so amazed to be referred to this series.it had been long anything could catch my attention.i was kind off bored of routine content in many other series.black mirror is just more than awesome.the mind behind this has to be appreciated.it not just entertainment but a food for thought kind off series.what creativity,what enactment superb drama !! i am actually short of words due to the uniqueness of this work. a view may be dystopian one at times but is really mind boggling.tons pf appreciation and hatsoff to the creativity.\",\"i just finished season 6 at morning. best episodes are \\\"beyond the sea\\\", \\\"joan is awful\\\". i will give 9\\u002f10points on these episodes. there are giving some thoughts. but other episodes are so messy. i didnt feel like that im watching \\\"black mirror\\\". its seems like ahs (american horror story) or some normal horror thriller series. i was waited so long and now little bit disappointed. where is the old black mirror feeling? just i forced myself to finish watching it (especially episode that mazey day and demon 79) its so boring and messy trash episodes.for me the best seasons are 1, 2 and 3. i miss old episodes.\",\"to sum up this series for me is quite easy, it's a dark look at what could be, and a very deep look at the worst of human nature. the cast and set are different every time, but one theme i found recurring was that each episode was extremely haunting, and it definitely gets the viewer thinking about what could be if the world was just a little bit different. i don't think black mirror will appeal to everyone because some themes are a slightly uncomfortable especially in the pilot episode. so far the actors that have been cast have done an amazing job, and the writers have managed to make some far fetched ideas seem graspable. basically this series is unlike anything else on tv and for that it gets a big thumbs up from me. i don't want to write any spoilers, but what i will say is this if you want a drama with dark twist or a series that is completely original make it black mirror.\",\"black mirror will go down as one of my all time favourite shows. the story of each episode so twisted but yet believable is hard to describe untill your 30 mins into an episode and glued to the screen. the technology aspect is so clever and imaginative and has you hooked from the first second. absoulty avoid season 5. (would have been a 10 otherwise)this is my first ever review and i wrote it purely from my frustration of season 5. another show destroyed from lazy writing and no character depth what so ever... has to improve\",\"black mirror is the anthology series we've been wanting the uk to make in a very long time. each episode is a self-contained story that could easily be used for episodes of shows like doctor who and such. the thing that makes black mirror so good is its exploration of futuristic utopias, how technology affects the world when we've reached a breaking point, and it's got the open-ended anthology nature of the twilight zone. it's basically a contemporary equivalent of twilight zone for the 2010s.i love black mirror. i discovered it when netflix revived the series in 2016, and the stories it tells are interesting and unsettling. is all that happens in the world of black mirror the right thing to do? do the character even know the difference between right and wrong? see this show asap. it's not going to fizzle anytime soon; but get a netflix account if you don't have one already.\",\"just stumbled across this so far watch 5 story's that interested me wasn't disappointed animation was astounding. it's like animated black mirror series.\",\"(rating for the full series is a 9 so far, 8\\u002f10 for the sixth season).black mirror is a classic tv show at this stage, a bold dystopic depiction of how our relationship with technology can take some really dark turns and be the cause of some bizarre and scary situations in our future.but black mirror is way more than just a show about the bad effects of technology in our society since it also explores some really interesting themes of human behavior, i would argue that this is actually what the show is about, how we humans will behave when equipped with these new technical tools with an infinite amount of potential, and let me tell you, based on the dark minds of the people behind the show the future seems really gruesome!being an anthology all episodes are completely independent from each other, some are way better than others so its hard to rate an entire season since some of the best episodes are scattered among all six of them (so far).the show usually mixes drama with suspense, mystery and sometimes a slight pinch of comedy, but one thing is certain, your anxiety levels will without a doubt be continuously high for most episodes.as i mentioned you have amazing episodes across the series, sometimes it's due to the technology being highly creative, other times its just that the story is really amazing in any case they are for the most part compelling episodes.you have some that seem a bit pointless or its hard to understand the underlying message but overall its a really great concept.addressing this last season in particular, i really enjoyed it, in comparison to the previous one which felt a bit blend it amped up its game, curiously enough there were a few episodes that went a bit outside of your usually technology driven narrative but contrary to what people are saying it wasn't completely void of it - two of them are social commentary about streaming services which lets not forget might not be advanced tech to today's standards but its a major technological revolution.and the last episode was completely outside of your usual black mirror type but was really good, it was more of a psychological \\u002f horror approach but i really found it enjoyable, great character chemistry! the series doesn't have a roadmap its okay to go a bit outside of the standard from time to time specially in an anthology tv show.go watch the sixth season and don't be stuck in the pre conceived ideas of what it should look like, enjoy the change - with this being said if they keep doing more seasons i do hope they go for more grim technological scenarios in the future as some of the classic old school ones of the early seasons!\",\"black mirror is a uniquely bleak sci-fi drama that delves into the darkness of future(istic) technology. it provides a cynical but also grounded view by how some concepts that seem great to have in theory, could destroy many relationships, humans and more. but. this goes for the first 3 seasons and partly 4th season. the show has dropped off significantly and has lost it's identity sadly.i can't believe i haven't reviewed this yet. but here we go. i just finished season 6. and i have to say, this show is done. it's heyday's are over. up until season 4 (if i'm a bit more harsh s3) it's such a unique and enjoyable show exploring the darkness of tech. it was creative, at times a gut punch, emotional, well acted and directed. it was all there. after s4 it started to feel like ''shorts'' that overstay their welcome and don't really hook into the core identity of the show. and it lost me.if i would recommend anyone the show it would be to watch till season 3 for the essentials. episodes such as ''the entire history of you'' ''white bear'' ''be right back'' ''white christmas'' ''san junipero'' (my favorite) and more, you honestly can't go wrong with any episode of the first 3 seasons. season 4 started showing signs of regression.san junipero deserves a special shoutout, that episode stuck with me for weeks. it's a incredibly well done episode and to it's core based on such a strong emotional foundation. death, life, existentialism. for me it was an episode that made me reflect and ask questions to myself. a sign of a strong episode. now in contrast, san junipero could be a seen as out of place in the lineup of s1-3 episodes. as it's not depressing in a traditional sense for the show. but... uniquely depressing in a happy way, if that makes any sense.overall, though, the show has great direct, lovely acting and always felt solid all around. just fantastic. it does hold the standard throughout most seasons. some episodes here and there feel weaker than others, as is expected with a anthology series. but i don't remember crazy poor performances or sloppy episodes in a technical sense.this show has had episodes i will never forget. and that's worth something. sadly, the last couple seasons were dull and i'm done with giving the show a chance each time. the writing just isn't there anymore.\",\"this is one of those shows that from the description you just aren't sure if it will be for you. it's worth it. this show creates different levels of attachments to the characters in the short period of time you have with them. production value means nothing if the story doesn't grab you and pull you in, but do not underestimate the power of having these two elements in an excellent mini-series. the creativity that went into each unique story is enthralling! it's absolutely worth taking the journey that is \\\"black mirror\\\".characters - 9\\u002f10 creativity - 10\\u002f10 cinematography - 8\\u002f10 editing - 8\\u002f10\",\"this series explores complex, futuristic and themes, with beautiful, beautiful animation. each episode is a unique and polished work of art and mini film in its own right. the episodes vary in lengths and styles of animation, some are more lighthearted and some are deep, disturbing and dystopian. it is one of my absolute favourites 😍 i would also say that if you love black mirror you'll likely love this.\",\"definitely that black mirror is a great series, i simply advice all people to see this great show. in the beginning, the three first episode can be a little strangers and not so good like you are waiting for, but if you still seeing the rest of seasons, you will stay addicted that you wanna see more and more, because it's something really interesting. just only more one thing, the most of episodes don't have nothing connected with previous episodes, but each of them are a great show that worth so much see. 10\\u002f10\",\"black mirror may have had some potential in the past, before it turned into a pretentious and bland bore that only serves to show us how there can be a different celebrity in every episode.rarely is an episode good, this is one of the most overrated series i've ever seen.some episodes had potential, but usually the ending would be disastrously bad or the writers could not resist boring us with various \\\"lessons\\\".most of the series is so pretentious that it simply overshadows the little that is good, and the series gets worse and worse as it goes on.the endings of the episodes are banal, naive and serve only to serve us some kind of messages that are so forced that one has to think that all this is just a good parody. but it is not.most of this series is hilariously pretentious, boring and tiresome. there are too few good episodes, the rest are unwatchable.overrated, mostly boring and hilariously pretentious.\",\"season 6 is not black mirror anymore.really is that the same guys who did the first 3 seasons and then the rest?its impossible to believe on that ....\\nthe first 3

seems to be like a black mirror episode was the s06e03 and yet this was on the limits.all the rest is totally waste of time.i dont know if this was netflix error or the creators error.but for someone like me who is a totally admirer of the first 3 seasons of black mirror, the last things is total disaster !\",\"black mirror started out great and has had a good run with the first four seasons. season five had no quality, despite only consisting of 3 episodes. rest in peace.\",\"\\\"black mirror\\\" - what an interesting name.\\n i didn't expect much when friend suggested me to watch it, but with every episode i wanted more... i was intrigued, thrilled, sometimes terrified and breathless after watching. \\n so i watched all 3 seasones at the time and couldn't wait for next, then forgot about it until ... until season 4 came out ... at first all seems so familiar (atmosphere, dark\\u002flight scenes contrast, etc), but (no, but!) story didnt develope through the episode (watched 2 episodes so far), it was monotone with no chill going through my spine, no explicite scenes and it doesn't make you think (you just don't give a damn about episode, about ending, about subject in it) ... such disappointment\\np.s.: 10 stars for first 3 seasons, and maybe ~5 stars for season 4.\",\"this series decrease quality after netflix took it, but season 6 is worst trash that i watched in years. terrible waste of time. really bad stuff which shouldn't belong in black mirror series. some episodes are less bad than other but overall experience is awful. is it possible that somebody get paid to make this garbage?!!! i really can't believe that somebody approved this mess. there are many english shows that americans spoil in their versions, but this us too much.i have only one message to people who didn't watch this - just don't watch it. don't waste your time. don't spoil memory of once good show.\",\"black mirror is one of the best shows currently on tv. the updated twilight zone-style show blends twisted reality with technology in the near future. each episode from season 1-4 is easily watchable and at least very good, while many episodes are brilliant. sometimes the twist isn't at the end...but at the beginning or the middle...it always keeps you on your toes and delivers. you find yourself saying, \\\"i could see that happening within the next 5-10 years.\\\" and some of the plot lines are starting to drift into reality today. black mirror seasons 1-4 are a must watch.then there is the fifth season. do not bother. each show is terrible. the stories get ridiculous, are pointless, or have characters you just do not care about. like too much in hollywood these days diversity was put ahead of story the episode called striking vipers. it has an lgbt storyline...that isn't really lgbt...and doesn't seem to know what to do with itself other than check off a box for an lgbt theme. they weren't willing to go where it needed to go or just thought virtual reality sex would be enough to make it interesting...it does not. check out the earlier episode, san junipero for a brilliant lgbt storyline that works on all levels. episode 2 in season 5 is completely forgettable. and episode 3 with miley cyrus attempts to make you feel sorry for vacuous pop stars but instead makes you hate them all the more. season 5 seemed mailed in without much effort.season 6 needs to be a great improvement or the show could lose viewers. watch seasons 1-4...skip season 5 altogether.\",\"black mirror is a pretty good show. it's interesting enough, but i don't think it's near as great as everyone says it is. my favorite episode is hang the dj.\",\"the double entendre that is black mirror's name summarizes the show perfectly. the first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. this is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. the black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. the stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. this show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. the presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but i would remind them that the show is twilight zone-esque in structure as well as theme. the episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. the second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.black mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. it unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. the thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that i have seen. it not only holds the viewer's attention while it plays, it enthralls your thoughts long after the credits roll.\",\"if you want to mess with your mind, black mirror is the show to watch. while taking pieces of current society, it creates a world that is believable. i wouldn't say it's necessarily horror or anything along those lines, but it gives you a chill throughout your body. i also love how each episode is unique of its story, so it doesn't necessarily drag on like other shows.\\nthe acting is great mostly, sometimes it isn't the best - but the strong actors pull through. the scenery, plot, costuming, etc. is outstanding. it's a diverse cast, and you can understand how the talent got to be there.\\ni love black mirror. thanks for messing with my mind, and creating the idea that the world we live in, may be a simulation \\u003c3\",\"i have never seen anything worse than this my whole life!!there's people stopping others from comparing this to black mirrorfirst off...black mirror is also garbage...but this...to call this garbage is disrespectful to garbagethe animation is pretty good it's true...but there's absolutely no storythis deserves a rating lower than zero.\",\"black mirror is just brilliant. awesome and a fine blend of sci fi, drama and technologies. stories are compelling, thrilling and surely keeps you glued. i was surprised by the first season, then binge watched the rest of the season. after season 3 it went downhill. even season 4 was good to a extent but it completly faded away in season 5. but stiill i would not restrict myself to give this series a 8.\",\"i saw the titte in netflix and i thought it was another sitcom series and saw the trailer.... i was stupified by the amount of different animations and wanted to give it a try. simply and utterly wow and mindblown. each episode has its own team of animators and story.\\nthis could easily be called the black mirror of animation.\\neach and every story has its own twisted plot in which you end up amazed by the quality and jawdropped work of the team behnd it.\\nits been just a day since it streamed in netflix and i ve already shared to my whole list of friends like crazy.\\ni gladly recomended it\",\"the premise to black mirror is not too dissimilar to the twilight zone. each episode has its own unique characters fight against some form of technology. the twilight zone focused on the moral goodness and hope for humanity while black mirror can be far more depressing and reflect the negative tendencies of society.my favorite aspect of the series is the negative effects of technology. i don't think that has been a part of conversation in society, but it is true. netflix's recent documentary the social dilemma highlights this, but black mirror takes this concept forward. there is so much we don't understand about our existence and our place in the world: our existence, extraterrestrial life or the unknown effects of greenhouse gasses that are rapidly causing climate change. we keep discovering and exploring, but at a certain point we have to realize we need to stop.this is the focal message of black mirror: understanding the negative effects of technology and of human nature. i think this show was needed before the pandemic to wake people, to make them realize technology and people have faults. i do not think something like this is needed at this time, it will most likely just make our current situation feel more depressing.i am optimistic about the existence of humanity. we need to learn from our mistakes and realize the massive potential we have to cause our extinction through technology or other means. technology is painted as something that causes humans to be cruel, which is true just not to the degree portrayed in the show. certain episodes seem to display technology as a way to be cruel and mask or expose their insecurities. charlie brooker is a complete genius because every episode captures these feelings no matter the different technologies used.i love the show even though it can be slightly depressing depending on the episode. i highly suggest to skip the first episode about the british pm, it scarred me for months before i could watch any other episode. brooker has a real message behind every single one of his episodes and that is why i love watching them. maybe season 5 was not his best work, but i am excited to see how this pandemic has inspired him to create innovating, daring stories going forward! please watch this show, it is definitely worth your time!\",\"credit must be given in all episodes to the animators - the levels of technical detail and stylised novelty is incredible in every instance, showing glimpses of future possibilities. the storylines themselves, as with anthologies, are hit and miss. personal preference will play a large part (for instance, imdb reviews of some episodes are far from what i think), but on the whole explore interesting concepts. some are even genuinely forward thinking, emulating black mirror-esque storylines.being only 5-15 minutes long, they are all easy watches; thus, even the unenjoyable ones are only short interludes. i would give this a watch purely out of curiosity - at least one of these sci-fi stories is bound to entertain.\",\"i only just recently started to watch black mirror, after seeing its name practically everywhere - i know, i know, late to the party by at least a decade.i was pleasantly surprised by the content of this show, and it's refreshing to watch an anthology series, where each episode tells a different story. it makes things a lot easier for casual viewers like me, or people who go back to watch a show after abandoning it for a time. the production, direction and cinematography should be highly praised for such visually dynamic episodes - each bizarrely different from the last, in both good and bad ways.i, for one, think this series is an essential watch that should be on everyone's bucket list. it gets you thinking about the repercussions (and benefits) of technology, digital media and ai (all of which are steadily overtaking the world right this moment).\",\"it's sad to see what have netflix has done with this series.black mirror used to be aboutplausible future towards which we can potentially goan extrapolation of a situation which initially would seem as usual, progressive and acceptedalways converging into a bleak end that leaves you battling an existential crisisthese three were the corner stone of black mirror.netflix in season 6 has maybe, with a long stick, has touched one of those 3 from a far. they completely destroyed the concept of the show and for me it wasn't just watching a cliché light horror show, it was huge disappointment, i really liked this show.\",\"the series is a beautiful short stories. for all people who loved black mirror, this series will be onyour favorite list.\",\"i'll keep this review short and simple. black mirror is horror that we live on a daily basis. i feel like me typing out this review could be made into a black mirror episode that would scare the crap out of me. there are no cheap jump scares, no things that go bump in the night. this is pure psychological warfare. this is questioning your reality. the scariest part? we're always one second away from being a black mirror episode...or maybe we're already living in one right now. black mirror is one big glitch in the matrix and i'm living for it. no matter what device you're reading this review on right now, once the screen times out, there's only you, and your reflection in that black mirror.\",\"black mirror is the most hard-hitting hypothetical on the psychological horror of unhampered technological advance i've ever seen... it reminds us that the potential side effects or opportunities for abuse are as limitless as human nature, and easily as devastating as biological tampering. our current reckless obsession with pushing forward and rolling out new gadgets and systems without any thought for the potential consequences, combined with our smug self-assurance that technology is always beneficial to humanity is truly what makes this terrifying stuff. guns in the hands of children. a brilliantly conceived and written show. i could not fault the acting, editing, camera-work, set pieces, soundtrack, scripting or effects. i honestly haven't been blown away by such a genius social commentary since... well forever. do yourself a favour and watch them all. you may find yourself looking at your mobile phone with a strange sense of revulsion afterwards. not to mention the internet.\",\"black mirror is, first of all, sf (this is for all of the other reviewers saying that it s unrealistic). second, the episodes are not made or thought to be masterpieces by their acting or dialogs or even effects . they catch the simplicity of a normal lifetime moment but with the dark immersion of future(maybe!) technology. it's the underlined ideas that are important here. all the other elements are basic on porpoise so you can focus on all the consequences our future choices can bring. and to be honest, where in the world have you seen full on perfectly serious played drama with mindblown visual and whatever effects for a satyr!?.\\nlast but not least, some of the actions of the humanity are disgusting, horrific, and repulsive. some is a way too small and insignificant word for this actually. i don't understand how some of you are so surprised.all in all, whoever's reading this, i advice you to give it a try if this is what you were willing to do and please, watch more than 1 episode. if you ask me, start with white christmas (episodes are individual).\",\"the biggest problems with black mirror are similar to a show like the twilight zone. making a show where each episode is different from the next can result in a mixed bag of quality.\\nseriously though black mirror is great because when it gets its satire right, it is truly unforgettable. i can't stop thinking about the christmas special because of its fantastic ending. there are duds in this shows run obviously, but they aren't awful episodes. it's a strong show and there is not much more i can say\\nalso watch bandersnatch\",\"man, i loved this series so much! i've watched since it first came out and in 2022, i rewatched all the episodes again and loved them just as much as when i first watched. i just finished season 6, and episode 1 (joan is awful) was awesome. the the space episode (beyond the sea) was interesting. but the others were awful. really disappointed since i was thrilled to have a new season. the other episodes weren't at the black mirror caliber and could have been just a regular show or a regular short movie. i hope they continue to make seasons but really hope they find what made them so unique - interesting storylines that haven't been explored in any other type of show or movie. black mirror is special for their innovative ideas. even if an idea isn't 100% new, they always had a unique spin on it. season 6 just doesn't live up to the other seasons.\",\"i had to leave a review after seeing all the terrible reviews people are leaving saying netflix ruined season 6. that couldn't be further from the truth! i loved every single episode!! people are saying these new episodes aren't black mirror. they are exactly black mirror. every one of them makes you think. i don't rewatch shows and i've been wanting to rewatch them.it annoys me how people are saying they love this show and want more seasons but leave terrible reviews. well... do you think we will get more if everyone leaves bad reviews???? no. support the show. don't bash it!i loved it! please give us more seasons!\",\"the series centers around it's title with both it's meanings. black mirror is another way of saying screen, tv screen, ipad, iphone...etc. there is also the literal meaning, a mirror that reflects the darkness in our nature. in each episode the black screen is used as a way to reflect the worst humanity back at itself. black mirror changes the story, setting and actors with every episode. each is a self contained plot though it seems to happen within the same universe. this keeps things interesting and fresh with the motto show, show, show. i found the first episode to be re-pungent, since this was the one used in the trailer before the show aired i had avoided this series for years. fortunately the first two episodes were the most... i'm going to use the word controversial here since the one that comes to mind would be censored. after that the show finds it's moral footing. because of this i don't think it's for everyone however the ideas and scenarios in the show are not too far fetched as regardless of the plot of the episode there is always the a central theme of focusing on the spectacle, of how things will be perceive. rather than the person or their actions. in a world governed by likes and star ratings, this makes sense and i would recommend it. just maybe skip the very first episode if you didn't find the trailer appealing.\",\"season 6 was like watching \\\"tales from the crypt\\\" or \\\"tales from the darkside\\\" or that awful newer series \\\"american horror stories\\\". other than episodes 1 & 3, this season didn't even remotely feel like i was watching \\\"black mirror\\\". what a complete letdown. for some reason, with the exception of episodes 1 & 3, the writers decided to go in the direction of the bad horror and exploitation movies of the 70s and early 80s. episode 1, although more in line with a traditional black mirror episode was a complete mess - especially the last five minutes. if salma hayek knew she had signed the contract and was appearing as \\\"tv joan\\\", i'm not sure why anyone else wouldn't also recall signing a contract to also appear as a \\\"tv joan\\\". episode 3 was also more in line with a traditional \\\"black mirror\\\" episode but it just couldn't save the entire season.\",\"there are very few movies or shows that have me glued to the screen, waiting breathlessly for the next scene. black mirror is one of them. each episode is completely different but the casting is spot on each time and the story lines are brilliantly written and brought to life. i found the technological theme very thought provoking. there are small details that contribute to the feeling that the episode could happen to us at any time, now or in the future. even the futuristic episode (episode two out of the three i have watched) seemed not only plausible but probable, in one way or another. fitness as a requirement for making their version of money? in our society obsessed with shape, weight and size? absolutely!!curse my job that needs me to be present

well!with every episode you ask yourself, \\\"what would i do in this situation?\\\" and \\\"is it possible that it will come to this at some point?\\\".of course, everyone has their favorite episodes.mine are:\\nfifteen million meritsthe entire history of youshut up and danceblack museumunfortunately, i have to say that i really didn't like season 5 and i hope that \\\"black mirror\\\" will return to its old character in season 6.nevertheless, highly recommended and refreshing!!!season 6 update:many say black mirror has lost its dystopian character with this season, but actually there is only 1 episode this season that doesn't fit into the concept of the series and that is the last \\\"demon 79\\\" - and demon 79 is not supposed to fit into that at all fits the basic concept of the series and is much more of a movie that could be released in the black mirror universe. this can also be seen at the beginning of the episode, because this episode doesn't start with the typical black mirror intro. according to its own statement, the episode is a \\\"red mirror film\\\" - so it doesn't serve under the typical black mirror banner.the show's creators say they've been experimenting with this season to bring something fresh and new to black mirror. this season wasn't well received, so it's safe to assume that season 7 (if there is one) will feel more familiar to viewers.\",\"everyone seems to be giving negative reviews. whether the originality or culture of the beginning of black mirror has somewhat dissipated it does not mean the captivating writing, acting and stories are gone.my biggest reason why i loved black mirror in the first place was the shock and uncertainty each episode brought whether it was based on technology or not. who cares is what i say. yes it's a different season but still phenomenal, mysterious and shocking none the less. and again the acting and writing are always on point. lay off the hate and show some love for such an original series.each episode of black mirror is a captivating experience in itself. horror, technology and gore or not. every time i start an episode it has always left me with the unexpected. season 6 included.\",\"i started watching this show some years ago but stopped at season 1 which is quite bad. but as i am big scfi fan and not much of scfi shows are watchable nowdays i gave black mirror another try.and i have to say show is really worth it. apart from season 1 which as i stated before is quite bad the rest of seasons are really great. especially season 3 where every episode is a masterpiece, but seriously a masterpiece.\",\"i just finished black mirror and the first word that comes to mind is...wow! i've never seen anything like it. the stories are all shocking, disturbing and thought provoking. most of them are about how technology is changing, has changed us, and not always for the better. it's almost like a satire of how media obsessed we have gotten. each episode really makes you think afterwards and will make you want to talk about what happened. every episode is like a mini movie, there're stand alone episodes and every episode has an incredible cast filled with a-list actors. while everyone will have their own favorite episodes, every single one of them will make you think and there's not a \\\"bad\\\" episode in the entire series.\",\"i am a new imdb user, usually i rate tv series, movies, by just giving it a rating to my friends or recommend it to them. but black mirror is a different story, oh yes. this piece of art here, deserves much more of my attention, and i mean a lot more. currently i am in season 4, episode 3, but i have plenty of reasons to write this review. i accidently started with season 4 episode 1. didn't know what the hell was going on, but it was good so i decided to watch episode 1 season 1. and it was an entire different story, a different setting. at the end of it, i was just blown away. while i thought that the entire series was based on what i saw in s4 episode 1. it showed me how powerful these episodes are, that even one single episode could make me watch an entire tv show of it. and that's what black mirror delivers, it delivers great mini-movies. black mirror tries to hold a mirror infront of you, or someone around you. some of it may confront you with personality traits that you own. it also shows that science evolves faster than our own instincts and how to deal with science when it's combined with desires in general. making us question if technology is a step forwards or a step backwards. if you haven't watched black mirror, then wait no longer! you have no idea how great this tv show is. it's a rare piece of art that is hard to come by. the only thing that will be saddening for me, is what the hell will i watch after this? to me no other tv show can actually compete let alone be compared to what this art is.a big fat 10\\u002f10 for me!\",\"black mirror is a british anthology series created by charlie brooker. while each episode presents a different world with different characters, all of them have a common underlying theme - the dark side of technology. in this review, i am going to discuss aspects of this tv series that makes it my favorite of all time.firstly, the show has the ability of presenting a very depressing, dystopian world that could actually happen in present time. this aspect makes the viewing experience much more terrifying. the characters presented are also three-dimensional and have a lot of nuance on them. this makes the audiences care and feel invested on them. moreover, the high production values adds an extra layer of realism to the world since it looks very realistic. additionally, the stories teaches a lot of moral lessons that audiences can learn. last but not least, the great cinematography presents a visceral experience as every shot is composed beautifully, with a slow creeping camera movement and many wide shots.it is a revolutionary piece of television that will stand the test of time and be remembered years from now.\",\"there isn't much to say about it. season 1 started off nicely, season 2-4 blew my mind with great episodes and some decent ones. season 5 is a letdown, since there it lost the feeling of what black mirror is in all the other seasons.\",\"black mirror is a modern science fiction thriller. the show tackles topics which are scarily possible and make you question everything about the world. the concept is intriguing. i've noticed that most if not every episode starts off as a utopian fiction and all the characters look happy using the new technology. everything seems right until the turning point. the start of every episode feels like the calm before the storm. the downfall comes after the turning point and honestly, this is the best part. the downfall shows an eerily possible reality of the world we live in. for the most part, in these downfalls, the use of the technology leads to the antagonist experiencing trauma. after each episode, personally i breathe a huge sigh of relief as i finally wake up from the illusion which is the black mirror episode and realise that none of this is happening to me. i would recommend this show to anyone who is looking for a science fiction thriller and is mature enough to handle the immersive, thought provoking episodes.\",\"you know when you get a great steak? so you go back to the restaurant and order it again. well it ain't easy getting it right every-time..black mirror started out as a low budget channel 4 uk gig and picked up a fanbase so the usa took it forward. to their credit the bigger budgets delivered greater productions. the whole things a great watch. series 5. well its stumbling a little. first one out wasnt great the next was good and the third with miley cyrus got mixed reviews. i liked that one the most. overall if your a scifi fantasy type of lover your at the right gig. 9\\u002f10\",\"after five intriguing and thought-provoking seasons delving deep into ethical and moral issues intertwined with potential scenarios driven by technological advancements, the sixth season unfortunately takes us back to the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, completely devoid of any typical technological interventions. in my opinion, this is clearly a step back for the series, which had already gained fame for its unique ideas and execution. the stories in the sixth season are overly simplistic, lacking the depth and complexity that provided ample material for debate and discussion. several episodes are confined to a limited setting, resulting in constructed narratives that gradually become illogical and hard to bear. i would not recommend this sixth season to anyone who enjoys dark, technology-driven stories, as it lacks any wow factors and compelling narratives.\",\"watched 3 episodes of season 6 and it remarkable how the mighty fall; nothing to recommend, no spoilers here, but please don't waste your time; a pale imitation of the great preceding seasons - should have quit while ahead.having said that, previous seasons are mostly very good, so maybe i'm being a bit harsh, but have to bring this up as it is a real let down.i will not be going on to further episodes; my desperate hope of something better is not enough now that i have seen the initial episodes, which were well below par.just look at the previous seasons, some of them are absolutely brilliant :-)\",\"if you want an animated black mirror series, then this is it! however, some of the episodes are predictable and some verge into extremely abstract domains.\",\"wow!! i've been a long time fan of black mirror, and while a lot of the previous episodes were hit-and-miss, this season was incredible!! not one episode failed to amaze, the writing and acting were immaculate and nothing was predictable. it was worth the wait, and my only regret is that i can't watch it again with fresh eyes. i cannot state strongly enough how great this show is, and i hope it continues for many, many more seasons. i cannot think of one episode of season 6 i liked more than the others, insanely well-done, well-produced and probably the best thing on television right now. maybe the best in the past decade.\",\"for choosing another way to keep black mirror alive and netflix for streaming this. this was a great surprise i'm so excited and happy. i'm ignoring phone calls because of this lol. i'm texting everyone i know. enjoy coffee with me or whatever you like with me. i'll be sure to rewatch the second episode because i'm texting this right now. i wish i could include emojis to express how i'm feeling right now. just typing to meet the character requirements. that's all folks this

!! bring back the true black mirror !\",\"the first two seasons of black mirror are probably my favorite content ever to be produced for tv. it's been fuel for a couple existential crisis's and it wears proudly it's heart on it's sleeve. no other tv show has put me in such a trance like state. every single single scenario feels absolutely plausible, and when it doesn't, it's only because of this coating of sarcasm that makes itself obvious to the spectator. the casting is perfect.\\nwhat i love the most is the fact that every single episode becomes absolutely captivating after maybe 20 minutes, and never stops from there. i don't see this as a science fiction show. to me it feels like a social experiment, where they basically created a sandbox in order to play with the flaws of humans, showing that no matter how much technology evolves, we're still the same.if only i could say that about the entire series.after white christmas, the stories lost their meaning. you can still enjoy the very forward thinking implementation of how humans would react to new tech, but it definitely feels more plastic. it's politics are mostly gone, and only present in very cliche narratives. this doesn't apply to everything though, hang the dj and san junipero are both beautiful examples of how much they can play with your emotions in a productive way.give this show a try. even if you disagree with it's premise, it's still nutrient-rich fruit for thought.\",\"black mirror is one of those programmes that never, no matter what, disappoints. after emotionally tearing you apart, psychologically intoxicating you, and even after intellectually stimulating to the point of lunacy, you will still be looking forward to watch an other episode. however, you will only be marvelled that each episode contains different characters, setting and plot. this certainly happened to me and i couldn't stop thinking about how a future that seems so distant in the episodes, could actually be the state of humanity in 10 minutes. maybe this is the reason why black mirror is so good. it leaves you to think what happens after the episode has finished and your screen has turned black. turned into a black mirror itself.\",\"black mirror is still discussing the current problems, over entertainment, over dissemination and over memory, but the writers put their background on the future

frontline of utilizing technology. these dystopian uses of technology are the critical substance of the series' dna, giving us some excellent and hugely inventive episodes, in all five seasons.season 06 seems to be ignorant about such previous themes, suggesting episodes that deal with vampires to angels and other sort of bullcr@p! what is wrong with netflix and its writers? did they work on the episodes during the writers' prolonged strike? do yourself a favour and avoid watching season 06!\",\"i am impressed by this excellent series. each and every episode is like a stand alone movie -

probably the best series\\u002fmovie(s) i have seen for many years - or ever. i am grateful for artists and producers that create material of such quality. it awakens my own creativity as well.however, i would like to add a warning label: the stories are, to say the least, not inspirational uplifting - reminding you the title \\\"black mirrors\\\". this is not the best pick on bad and depressing days, or just before you go to bed. horror movies like blair witch is a good-night story by comparison. black mirrors challenges our deepest existential fears and unachievable desires in life.\",\"season 6 of black mirror illustrates a notable resurgence of the series, thanks to charlie brooker's willingness to experiment with new narrative structures and themes. its uniqueness lies in its unpredictability, keeping viewers constantly intrigued and pleasantly surprised as each episode unfolds a distinct story. a notable feature of this season is its exploration of human weakness and the integration of various genres, enriching its narrative depth. however, there seems to be a decrease in the show's prescience, although this contributes to its unpredictability. balancing all factors, while season 6 has a few misses and might not be as pointedly incisive as previous seasons, it is still worth watching for fans of the series, offering a fresh perspective and narrative variety.\",\"i rated this show a 10, but without season 5... it's sad when a show this good goes bad. it was interesting and new, the concept and ideea was intriguing and thrilling to watch. please bring back the old black mirror, i was looking forward to seeing the new season, but it's not worth it. don't ruin it please, it was so good... we don't have much interesting shows to watch\",\"the show is great not gonna lie, every episode has me thinking about whether to trust what i see or not, they change the story every time i mean if you start binging the show you cant predict whats gonna happen next it just happens and you like it too and it's well made that it can be watched from any episode its all anthology episodes and it's just too good of a show i'm just happy i got to see this show after a long wait... watch it, its a must watch and not even gonna take time its just small episodes... basically smaller and animated black mirror episodes, watch it!!!\",\"i've been watching black mirror for about 3 years now. i've seen every episode twice and some episodes 3, 4 or even 5 times (shut up and dance in particular). every episode is intriguing right from the very start and keeps viewers hooked into the story until the end, with each episode having a unique and fitting soundtrack to really set the mood. the plot twists in some episodes are incredible and unpredictable, and even watching those episodes again and again and knowing how the episodes end, they're still just as entertaining. the scariness of it though, is the reality of it. black mirror showcases how scary society could become in the 'near future', and the realism of how true it could all become is what's frightening. this realism adds to the thrill and horror of the show, and makes viewers especially intrigued into each episode.some episodes however, are better than others. hang the dj, san junipero, black museum, white christmas, shut up and dance, u. s. s callister and nosedive are among some of the best, and some of the not-so-entertaining ones, in my opinion, are metalhead, the entire history of you and rachel, and jack and ashley too is just a plain over exaggerated teen drama, which is not black mirror. but, i'm still giving this show a 10, as the complete and utter brilliantness of each episode's storyline and the incredible episodes overall outweigh the not-so-good ones.ive recommended black mirror to almost everyone i'm friends with, and it's always been a great entertainment\\u002fdrama to watch at hangouts.i'm currently re-watching the show and the subtle excitement i'm getting from a possible season 6 persuaded me to write this review. hoping it's better than season 5!\",\"black mirror takes a step forward in looking at the darker side of technology and social trends to a level of creativity i have not seen before. with each episode being it's own story, there are some losers in there. that being said, the concept is so good i have to look paste them and applaud the creativity and application of science fiction that isn't so far in the future that it is a guess. much of the technology used in the shows is in some stage of development (not all, most) making the future feel like next generation. the highlight is in how from a social and psychological standpoint close it is to where we are today. the general sense is a bit of twilight zone mixed with next generation technology mixed with possible evolution of social or application of the tech from a darker perspective. taking this next generation technology and exploring what hackers could do with it, how it could be used\\u002fmisused by those in power, and other variations on this theme. the one thing i found in common was that how many times i had no intention of watching an entire episode only to watch it, and the next, and the next. quite addicting and well thought out with hopes that netflix (which from what i can tell has taken it over) has done to improve it and increase the episodes. hoping the upward trend continues and the creativity not lost. one of the best shows i've accidentally watched.\",\"seasons 1-4 was a near masterpiece, season 5 was terrible, but still felt like a black mirror universe. then there's season 6, which didn't even feel like a black mirror show, other than episode 3, beyond the sea, which was pretty good and episode 1 which was pretty average. but you had 4 years to make up for season 5, but you release a bunch of random episodes that feel out of place. i mean it would've been decent episodes for twilight zone or something, but it just wasn't black mirror. i would drop the ratings to a 5\\u002f10, but out of respect for the first 4 seasons, i couldn't go lower than an 8\\u002f10 because it would've been a 9-10\\u002f10 if the series ended at season 4.\",\"the netflix series dark threatened to remove black mirror from being my number one series of all time,but they destroyed the ending worse than lost did,so here we are. still on the throne. this is our future and we are closer to it day by day.\\nwhat hooked me into the show was the first episode,the same that repelled so many people. from me it's an eternal 10. i see many hating on the 5th season,i loved it the same as all before,especially the second episode with andrew scott which is in my top 3 episodes. everything evolves,people. us,the creator of the show,the show. and time.\",\"as a black mirror major fan i long awaited season 5. one the best shows on cable with only a few sub par episodes. smithereens is not one of them it is one of the best mirrors ever. andrew scott our favorite from mystery was outstanding. edge of the seat with emotional depth and a dig on facebook to boot. i know if your a mirror fan you don't need to read this to the others just start with this one and you will be back for more. rich\",\"black mirror presents to the public, with sci-fi and drama stories, the consequences of technology evolution in a future society. created by charlie brooker, the british tv show won the international emmy award in 2012 as the best tv show in the year.presenting a completely different plot for each episode, the series, divided into 4 seasons, uses issues of our actual society mixed with future technologies and how the people would use it. the most stories approach dark themes, insisting to make a reflection about artificial intelligence and the ethical issues about it. despite the sci-fi side, we can relate each plot treated with nowadays issues and really see in this memorable tv show a mirror of our society and people's reactions. the viewer can put himself in the character's place and try to imagine what choice would take in each situation.using a mind blowing scene in the end of the episodes, black mirror makes you stop and think about right and wrong, where we will be and what we will be doing in the future, how the technology can affect us. all this context is perfect for the sci-fi lovers, who would easily spend all day long to watch all seasons in sequence.\",\"watching movie has always been my passion ever since i was a child. among hundreds of movies that i have watched, the series black mirror impressed me the most.the series consist of multiple episodes illustrating the dark side of technological development. for me, although these movies are not too long, they have very profound meanings. in detail each episode shows us how dangerous technology could be either when they fall into the wrong hands or when we are too dependent on it and let it takes over our life. for example, there is an episode in which a boy was forced to do nasty and horrible things so that his secrets, which were stolen from the internet, won't be exposed.to be honest, watching black mirror knocked me sideways since i have never imagined such scenarios could be possible. despite knowing that they are only imaginary situation, there is nothing to ensure that they won't be happening in the future in real life. in addition, very few special effects were used, which was according to me, very surprising since they still managed to fully deliver their messages. another factor contributed to black mirror's success is the performance of the actors. most of the actors are not well-known but they did a great job demonstrating the feelings as well as the personality of different characters. therefore, viewers could easily understand the gist of each episode.however, i feel that it is not suitable for certain people since it contains sexulal, nudity and violence content. on top of that, the series may be irritating for sensitive people to watch since in some episodes, the result or the message is quite scary to think about. another drawback for black mirror is that it is not packed with action scenes which sometime might be a bit dull for me.in short words, black mirror gives us a big picture of our tomorrow world experiencing a rapid growth in the field of technology about how dreadful it could be. although there are several minor cons, i find this series very though-provoking, all thanks to the amazing and creative minds of the director and screenwriter. there is no doubt that everyone should include black mirror in their must-watch list. with such meaningful content, i expect this series to gain even greater success in th future.\",\"4 seasons. 19 different sessions of mental trauma. \\nblack mirror is 10 times terrifying than the best horror movie ever. it is disturbing to even think about the scenarios presented in each episode. the tv series themes the fatal attraction between human and technology. black mirror stories happen in a dystopian society which is soon going to be a reality for many of us. the show instills fear about the future we're moving into. as the makers expressed, this show is certainly not for the faint-hearted.\",\"definitely worth seeing! definitely brilliant..definitely touching...the show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature..the stories are mostly set in a world that is badly influenced by modern technology. what makes \\\"black mirror\\\" special ?!..'details' , great filming,acting,directing ...asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. or maybe already have taken us. definitely worth seeing 👌\",\"finally have been waiting the long return of black mirror and it did not disappoint!season 5 was a disappointment except\\nepisode 2(smithereens) which is one of my favorites.the title of this review kinda gives it away.will say it also has kind of a truman show vibe to it as well.it will kinda keep guessing until about the last 15 minutes of it. then it comes together.all of the acting was done very well especially by\\nsalma hayek.not a traditional \\\"dark\\\" black mirror episode but none the less....... it was still great!looking forward to watching the rest of season 6!welcome back black mirror, you've been missed!!!\",\"the first two seasons are captivating and original, i couldn't look away. they were also british (which the show is meant to be). then something in the third season shifted, the writing of the episodes changed. i found myself bored, and they were american actors in very american episodes. guns and army personnel, had me distracted and disoriented, forgetting that i was still watching black mirror. i am yet to watch the fourth season, but i am hoping they go back to original ideas and mind the bending episodes, fans love so much.\",\"the only way i watch t.v. shows nowadays is by recommendation. there are so many shows that i could be completely consumed by them all and i can guarantee that over half of them are not worth my time. i actually heard about black mirror from a sports radio host and thought, \\\"that sounds interesting.\\\"i watched episode one of season three and was hooked. just as a refresher: season three ep one was titled \\\"nosedive\\\" starring dallas bryce howard. it was about a world in which ratings are currency and clout. every individual has a rating attached to him\\u002fherself that can be seen upon viewing the person's face. using a five star rating scale, those with a higher rating have greater privileges whereas those with lower ratings are the scourge of the earth. it was amazing to see what people would do just to get a five star rating (not too far from our current reality). i binged watched that entire season then watched all three seasons. just about every episode was genuinely thought provoking. these shows are extremely well done and offer so much food for thought. each episode is replete with quality writing, quality effects and filming and quality acting. black mirror is a netflix gem. it is twilight zone if it were rated r.\"],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"1_black_mirror_season\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[7.314843,6.363721,12.699369,12.994406,12.829233,12.837265,13.791112,12.754573,13.135826,11.910197,12.988368,12.608648,12.224538,12.789417,13.005232,12.053342,7.3469925,12.936489,12.929031,8.412185,13.5047,8.087575,8.468211,13.153569,7.4891663,12.704284,13.168812,13.738437,13.631377,7.319507,12.013449,9.164666,12.9787,12.699986,12.383379,12.391337,13.21462,13.494416,13.125731,12.540846,6.204724,12.9553385,12.995053,8.453952,13.312686,12.635772,12.628784,8.37783,13.691987,12.707087,12.0877695,12.808863,12.167342,12.938789,12.889916,12.679999,12.972177,13.511467,12.404164,12.295461,12.721027,12.686362,12.968562,12.420073,12.928239,12.175937,12.783497,12.453116,8.577126,12.172796,13.159691,12.752079,12.657476,13.8552885,13.569346,12.94194,13.84221,12.993401,12.966421,13.745065,9.2051325,12.816293,13.591386,13.12132,12.639959,12.383878,9.190655,13.416935,12.8607235,12.729762,12.637659,12.268511,12.779966,12.798719,12.364357,7.3193774,8.494376,13.691725,12.073323,13.063863,12.729521,13.228567,12.3061285,13.581409,13.733443,7.5979967,9.243297,11.811827,11.856246,6.256465,13.188086,13.1248665,12.960965,13.009645,13.183865,12.981174,13.008504,11.713979,12.206649,13.155944,9.358947,8.563922,13.232111,12.357945,13.634662,12.651559,12.983134,12.812553,7.316574,13.3076105,13.167671,12.138322,7.409608,12.140977,13.194604,13.791299,13.150719,12.160165,13.667161,13.068665,12.362274,12.838966,12.130321,6.0423765,12.341845,7.303044,12.831672,5.6102314,12.503784,13.805881,12.112719,12.70396,12.8873415,13.028893,12.987671,13.676685,13.471167,12.788552,13.714637,12.499998,13.629735,13.480581,12.158235,12.361886,12.828379,12.719978,12.986199,12.778475,13.032442,8.508558,8.523074,12.296229,13.605822,13.008578,12.873425,12.652194,13.171018,12.71007,12.525503,12.767817,13.771415,13.850033,12.723854,12.8911295,12.955323,11.87385,13.217514,12.623632,12.919473,13.234939,13.0295315,12.669065,12.872771,12.913731,12.425303,13.097365,12.787821,12.985213],\"y\":[1.4516606,3.3967733,3.9640284,4.5766,4.317158,2.7016485,4.3640666,2.57608,4.4705205,3.5176785,4.6952033,4.1845794,3.6142042,3.0239959,4.708711,3.579023,1.5013452,3.420593,3.9387853,5.124422,4.2816668,2.1406252,5.159552,3.6074996,0.8943962,2.8091094,4.3208437,4.3523135,4.3554482,0.6041288,3.552149,3.3892236,4.6746726,2.9760165,3.644446,3.6171935,4.4106307,4.3444257,3.970781,3.2542975,3.9167295,4.739804,4.677338,5.1335473,3.848839,2.5497506,2.9701192,5.0809135,4.327439,3.1109912,3.6391153,2.6344182,3.6590083,3.0263095,3.7102282,2.8191767,2.9456334,4.2727537,3.4841456,3.6706529,2.5537624,2.8487973,4.63754,4.257393,3.1080067,3.6981988,4.0499473,3.7642329,5.2032595,3.4563432,4.511869,2.6955163,3.5084443,4.404886,4.231574,3.606541,4.412891,4.685508,2.8479476,4.350395,5.3823576,2.7491724,4.4264874,4.6077485,3.223538,3.5241268,5.3963585,4.2927566,2.7842653,3.0606024,2.469751,3.985844,4.3013988,3.1116555,3.4287484,1.6129053,5.1755695,4.312237,3.5949695,4.6606483,2.7291203,4.409419,3.5832877,4.204721,4.338011,1.5410177,2.9949093,3.45965,3.4960556,3.2323964,4.1809554,4.0692267,2.9361677,4.6910954,4.1120987,4.69375,4.6968546,3.5049777,3.6466863,4.3863626,3.0343075,5.1959386,4.316011,3.4756005,4.3552914,3.089773,4.6687193,3.0691776,1.4286166,4.210047,3.9953778,3.7374167,1.5511603,3.6763146,3.8069506,4.367471,4.5253386,3.6517391,4.3463264,4.52709,3.6492937,2.781463,3.6116357,3.642271,4.1359463,1.5372185,2.6500592,1.9393901,3.4361706,4.375157,3.3793108,3.1435897,2.8034725,3.0697231,3.693097,4.2773294,4.2480855,3.0242717,4.34796,3.3423038,4.3794823,4.261044,3.7342288,3.5638242,3.5469441,2.592815,4.6968036,2.9548354,4.5022163,5.1612554,5.154334,3.5593874,4.3914757,3.603837,3.9721496,2.9496288,4.525876,3.267712,3.42335,2.6298797,4.3506775,4.402466,3.0456972,2.4886427,4.6393876,3.69083,4.371724,3.0167117,4.544941,4.264932,4.709882,2.4836476,2.6579232,2.9234908,3.2633893,4.6551304,

            "I just finished Black Mirror and the first word that comes to mind is...wow! I've never seen anything like it. The stories are all shocking, disturbing and thought provoking. Most of them are about how technology is changing, has changed us, and not always for the better. It's almost like a satire of how media obsessed we have gotten. Each episode really makes you think afterwards and will make you want to talk about what happened. Every episode is like a mini movie, there're stand alone episodes and every episode has an incredible cast filled with A-list actors. While everyone will have their own favorite episodes, every single one of them will make you think and there's not a \"bad\" episode in the entire series.\n",
            "You're reviewing the whole show here,not individual seasons or episodes. Don't give a low rating just because you didn't like Miley or the 5th series. Keep everything in context and just rate on your overall impression of Black Mirror. Carry on.\n",
            "Black Mirror is one of the most original and best Mini-Series ever created. Each episode tells a different story about the modern world we live in and the technology we all love and while not all, most of them are fascinating. They are all filled with a-list stars and made by great directors. Each stand alone episode is thought provoking and filled with enough drama and suspense to keep you at the edge of your seat. While there are a few episodes that are not as good when compared to the others, most of them are fantastic. This show gets compared to The Twilight Zone a lot and while it's a pretty good comparison, I think Black Mirror is actually a lot better. It's hard to explain how incredible this show is so just go watch it.\n",
            "Brilliant.Absolutely brilliant.This is NOT anti-utopian, it is an actual mirror of a utopian idea gone terribly wrong.I've only watched 3 episodes so far and each one has made me think, made me go back and look again, made me ask myself why this had never occurred to me before.I would call this sci-fi in the richest sense of the genre.... it is not about science, but how science affects human beings. The one thing that never seems to change is us. Technology evolves, mutates, advances and declines, but human beings, our feelings, our courage, fears, and desires remain within us.I love this show. I hope you will love it too. And I hope you will think.\n",
            "The double entendre that is Black Mirror's name summarizes the show perfectly. The first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. The presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but I would remind them that the show is Twilight Zone-esque in structure as well as theme. The episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. The second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.Black Mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. Let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. Watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. The thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that I have seen. It not only holds the viewer's attention while it plays, it enthralls your thoughts long after the credits roll.\n",
            "I have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity. Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters. There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture. Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us.\n",
            "This is the biggest surprise i came across these last couple of years. This series is one of the best i've seen. Every episode is unique yet criticizes the same absurd society we're living in. I was shocked at the great filming/acting/directing and of course writing of these different stories. My personal favorite would be episode 2. The most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode. I wont miss anything else Charlie Brooker does and i'm patiently waiting for the DVD to come out. I hope this also gets a Blu-Ray version and maybe some new episodes after wards?\n",
            "-1 because of that Season 5 that I wished I never knew existed.\n",
            "If you watch this whole series...you can see the reality of it...and it's horrifying. I believe that this series really makes you think about how easily and fast things can get out of control. It was an awesome show!\n",
            "I found myself irritated with one of the reviewers who gave this mini-series a terrible review because it left him feeling \"disturbed\". Ermm.... I think that's the intention....As many others have pointed out, the series is superbly put together: the actors are great; the script, if anything, is minimalist and the production excellent.This isn't reality TV. This picks out the darkest aspects of how are future in this this modern age could end up, in extremis....Personally, I think it's a Facebook/Twitter/Flickr/Android/iPhone/Tab/internet horror story and whilst I think it's probably too brutal for most people, it is a reflection of how we give up and of ourselves to the digital, overwhelmingly public way that the world now wants us to be.I love the show. Will it change my FB or other behavior? No but, truth be told, I might be watching out of the corner of my eye....\n",
            "Watching it was disturbing and shocking at the same time. Depressive in a way, but also genius and defying! The way it makes you question and think about reality and our modern technological ages it's brilliant!And although being fictional and mostly sci-fi, it's so realistic in the scariest way! It's not about tech... it's about us and our \"human nature\", the good and the bad, our best and worst as humans and that is definitely the most disturbing aspect of it all. Worth seeing it all with detailed attention cause it's probably one of the most intelligent and critical TV series done recently!! Thank you Mr Brooker and all the team!P.S.: the first two episodes are probably the most disturbing ones and it's curious that all the bad reviews focus only in the first one... Reading those bad reviews only make more sense to the all series idea... Shocking uh? But wouldn't we be all in the pub watching it?\n",
            "To sum up this series for me is quite easy, It's a dark look at what could be, and a very deep look at the worst of human nature. The cast and set are different every time, but one theme I found recurring was that each episode was extremely haunting, and it definitely gets the viewer thinking about what could be if the world was just a little bit different. I don't think Black Mirror will appeal to everyone because some themes are a slightly uncomfortable especially in the pilot episode. So far the actors that have been cast have done an amazing job, and the writers have managed to make some far fetched ideas seem graspable. Basically this series is unlike anything else on TV and for that it gets a big thumbs up from me. I don't want to write any spoilers, but what I will say is this if you want a drama with dark twist or a series that is completely Original make it Black Mirror.\n",
            "In the new golden age of tv shows, this one is on another level. That's saying something, considering the expectation we have now. Black Mirror is an anthology series that, if you follow dope stuff, has achieved that rare-air status that if there's another season you feel blessed. It's that good imo. Absolutely a 21st Century version of The Twilight Zone. And it keeps coming back, but on nobody's timeline. And A list stars just flock to it?! I don't really love each and every episode. But there are so many episodes of this program that really leave ya shaken. Because us doesn't seem that far removed from a plausible scenario. Check it out. It'll make ya wonder......\n",
            "When I talk about this show I always tell people to \"Just skip the first episode and watch it at the end.\" Other than that it's a mind blowing, ground breaking, and terrifying series. It shows exactly where humankind is currently heading and has already reached in some instances. A mirror can only show a reflection of what's already there so Black Mirror is an apt title.I've watched all the episodes multiple times and wish like crazy they had continued the show. It was one of the truly rare shows willing to take an unflinching look at humanity and how screwed up it is, and how much worse it's getting. In my experience, those who don't like the show seem to prefer living with their head in the sand while humming loudly to drown out the noise. Ignorance doesn't change the world, seeing it for what it is and then choosing to be better is what can do it.\n",
            "Black Mirror is a British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker. Each episode of the series presents a standalone story that explores the darker aspects of modern society, particularly the unanticipated consequences of the use of technology in our daily lives. The show explores various themes such as the impact of technology on society, privacy, surveillance, and human nature.The series is known for its dark and disturbing tone, and its ability to take a thought-provoking look at the ways in which technology is shaping our world. The show's episodes are diverse in terms of genre, tone, and style, with some episodes being more comedic and others being more dramatic and suspenseful.The acting in the series is also noteworthy, with a talented ensemble cast that delivers strong performances in each episode. The writing is also exceptional, with well-crafted and thought-provoking storylines that keep the audience engaged and thinking long after the episode has ended.One of the criticisms that could be made about the series is that some episodes are stronger than others, and some may not resonate with all audiences. Additionally, the series can be quite dark and disturbing, which may not be suitable for all viewers.Overall, I would recommend Black Mirror for fans of science fiction, anthology series, and those looking for a thought-provoking and thought-provoking series that explores the darker aspects of modern society and the impact of technology on our lives. The show's diverse episodes, talented ensemble cast, and well-crafted storylines make it a must-watch series. It's a unique and captivating series that keeps the audience thinking long after the episode has ended.\n",
            "Black Mirror has always been one of my favourite shows. It is completely different from everything else. It has been fresh, quirky and gripping in every respect. Every episode has been different and has transfixed me. It is now described as a Netflix original. It was on U. K TV years before it got to Netflix.I have been anxiously awaiting the release of season 6 which I've just binge watched over a couple of days.I was quite disappointed in Season 6 with some episodes having a familiar ring to them where I've seen very similar themes before, even in previous episodes.The best episode of season 6 from my perspective was episode 2 Loch Henry which was scary, original and brilliantly acted. Overall I found season 6 patchy and disappointing.\n",
            "This is truly an amazing show. The issues that the show grapples with and illuminates in each episode are timely and significant. To say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison. The stories are mostly set in a dystopian world that is dominated or badly influenced by modern technology. What makes \"Black mirror\" so great is the attention to detail and inter/intrapersonal relationships and how the main character would feel and experience its brave new world.\n",
            "Well thought out plots, characters, settings and really good storytelling. It asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. Or maybe already have taken us. Definitely worth seeing! Treat yourself and watch this. 9/10\n",
            "Black Mirror has been for me one of the highlights in drama over the last decade. Imaginative, dark, bleak, often cynical, but always absorbing, incredible viewing. What I wouldn't give to sit down and talk with Charlie Brooker, to find out where his ideas come from, and what plans he has for the future of the show. The more bleak they are, the more I tend to enjoy them, and the more an episode has that feeling of 'well that could really happen,' the more I love them still. I will admit I feared when the Channel Four arrangement ended, The Americanisation of the show did worry me a lot, but how wrong was I. The show has definitely changed, and improved for my money, episodes like Playtest and Metalhead are downright scary, while episodes like Hang the DJ and San Junipero tug at the heart strings. How on Earth do you pick a favourite episode, so many outstanding contenders, a few of the best include White Christmas and San Junipero, but the variety is so rich everybody will have a different favourite. I can't wait to see more in the future, Please Charlie :-)\n",
            "The creativity is the main problem, especially in modern culture product till 2000's. We always seen main concepts, same approaches and same faces on our TV's, and cinemas. Even trying something different and genius, has become very commonplace. But Black Mirror is totally different and witty. You need only five minute watching to understand this. Different point of view, different stories, different but natural talented faces... Some ideas in this artwork could be disturb you, but this makes it consummate. It questions your life, routines, choices you made, the basic code of ethics you have... At the end, you only feel the happiness of awareness. Thank you for showing me something different than usual, thank you for make me more aware.\n",
            "My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠How can anyone rate Black Mirror less than 10?! It's one of the most fascinating TV shows ever.Favourite Episodes : Be Right Back, San Junipero, Hang the DJ, The Entire History of You, Nosedive and Fifteen Million Merits.Bring on Season 5!\n",
            "Black mirror is SUCH a good a show and a definite must watch. Every episode is different. I love this show and have loved it since it first came out it's just so upsetting when you wait so long for a new season and there are only 3 episodes!! I just want there to be more. I really reccomed you check out this show!\n",
            "After watching the first episode, I was shocked about the negative reviews it received. I'm going to be honest, it wasn't what I expected but that doesn't make it bad. It was very dark, and very shocking; Had me completely on the edge of my seat throughout. You will have to watch it with an open mind as it is somewhat distasteful and well... extremely far-fetched (Which is pretty absurd for a satire, but I digress.) I did thoroughly enjoy it however, it hit all the right notes.After watching the second episode, I was left in shock about the jarring contrast from the first episode. It's so different than the prior, it's set in an alternate reality and is just.. unusual. Still dark, still intriguing, but didn't quite capture my imagination the way the first one did.The third and final instalment was probably my favourite of the 3. It was again, completely unrelated from the previous 2, but it had a really interesting concept and narrative, and was executed phenomenally. All in all, the series as a whole is very interesting, if somewhat inconsistent.\n",
            "Man, I loved this series so much! I've watched since it first came out and in 2022, I rewatched all the episodes again and loved them just as much as when I first watched. I just finished season 6, and episode 1 (Joan is Awful) was awesome. The the space episode (Beyond The Sea) was interesting. But the others were awful. Really disappointed since I was thrilled to have a new season. The other episodes weren't at the Black Mirror caliber and could have been just a regular show or a regular short movie. I hope they continue to make seasons but really hope they find what made them so unique - interesting storylines that haven't been explored in any other type of show or movie. Black Mirror is special for their innovative ideas. Even if an idea isn't 100% new, they always had a unique spin on it. Season 6 just doesn't live up to the other seasons.\n",
            "Personally, I cannot recommend the early seasons of Black Mirror enough. They were a revelation, offering genius and thought-provoking content that left a lasting impact on me. The show's ability to delve into the dark side of technology and society was unparalleled, making each episode a haunting and unsettling experience.However, as an avid viewer, I was left deeply disappointed when the show started to lose its original roots. The transition to American production seemed to dilute the essence of what made Black Mirror so special. The distinct British touch, which brought a unique charm and social commentary to the stories, began to fade away.The later episodes, influenced by the Americanized approach, felt less daring and more formulaic. The narratives became predictable, and the shocking twists and turns that once defined the series became scarce. It seemed as if Black Mirror had succumbed to the pressures of appealing to a broader audience, sacrificing its artistic integrity in the process.While I acknowledge that art and creative decisions are subjective, for me, the magic of Black Mirror started to fade as it strayed further from its original brilliance. The show's earlier seasons remain a testament to its ability to provoke thought, challenge societal norms, and ignite conversations about the perils of technology.In conclusion, I highly recommend indulging in the first seasons of Black Mirror, savoring their genius and thought-provoking narratives. However, I must caution against expecting the same level of impact as the series progresses. As it veers into a more Americanized territory, it loses the spark that made it a groundbreaking and captivating experience..\n",
            "Some of the episodes are simply fantastic. Some of them are just... not. It's up to the people behind each episode. The people writing, acting, producing all change every episode. That's awesome. It means that you get fresh ideas and are able to enjoy a wide range of amazingly creative people. Unfortunately, there are a few combinations that just aren't as good.On the whole: fantastic. Each part: roll of the dice.\n",
            "(Updated after Season 6).A series of independent stories, all centred around technology. Is it a help or a hindrance?Brilliant series, created and written by English comedian and social commentator Charlie Brooker. Highly original in its concept - examining possible technological advances, and seeing how these could be used, or abused, and how they can help us, or be the bane of our existence. Set at an everyday person level (mostly), so is highly engaging.Plots are very intriguing and entertaining, drawing you in and keeping you locked in until the end. Often part of the intrigue is figuring out the innovation depicted in the episode and how it works.In many of the earlier episodes, Brooker was happy to just make the revelation of the innovation the punchline, and then just let the episode run its course from there. These were not bad episodes - the are no bad episodes (the worst score I gave to an individual episode was 7/10) - but did leave me a bit disappointed. I kept thinking this series was going to be like Alfred Hitchcock in the 21st (or 22nd) century and the lack of a great twist towards the end or powerful conclusion made me wonder what all the fuss was about.However, with time Brooker's writing got better - grittier, more daring, more profound. He found his formula and pushed the envelope in terms of his creativity. While S2 E2 - White Bear - was the first episode I gave a 10/10 to, it was really only from Season 3 (starting with the brilliant Christmas special between S2 and S3 - White Christmas) where the series consistently delivered a punchiness to its endings. S3 E1 - Nosedive - was one of the scariest and depressing imaginings of future social interaction I've ever seen...and it was 100% plausible.Things then went from strength to strength. The pinnacle, for me, was S3 E6 - Hated In The Nation. A murder mystery combined with highly plausible technology, engaging, well-developed characters (well portrayed too) and a big swipe at social media and the types of people who inhabit it. You're forced to think about your own moral view on issues, while not being lectured as to what is the \"correct\" choice. Brilliant episode.Many aspects of the series give a damning, and quite relevant, view on society, and possibly where it is heading. It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some episodes that are quite upbeat, even romantic (San Junipero, Hang the DJ) and in S4 E1 - USS Callister - Brooker makes use of his considerable comedic talent to deliver an episode that is wonderfully funny yet grippingly thrilling and action-filled.Season 5 is a bit of a disappointment though. The plots are much more mainstream and less cerebral. There's flashes of the old Black Mirror but Brooker never really rams the point home or provides something profound. Very entertaining and still highly plausible but not of the same quality as the previous seasons.Season 6 was a surprise in that followed more than four years after Season 5 and most people, including myself, thought the show had finished. It follows largely in the same vein as Season 5. Episode 1 was more like the old Black Mirror but three of the five episodes are more horror-thriller orientated than the clever sci fi stuff of Black Mirror in its prime. All the episodes are still entertaining but, for the most part, the clever futurism of the earlier seasons has gone.Season ratings: S1-4 9.5/10, S5 8/10, S6 7/10.\n",
            "Black mirror is one outstanding series that introduces its audience to unique, interesting, problematic and worst of all terrifyingly possible visions of the future. Each episode tells a different story with a set of new characters (as an anthology does), but one main character stays the same - technology. Black mirror isn't annoying with anti-technology messages, it doesn't have the \"oh, technology bad, book good\" mindset, it focuses on many aspects and possibilities that technology may bring in the future, it doesn't judge, instead lets the viewers do the judgement and come to their own conclusions which was a breath of fresh air to be honest. The first and second seasons were a nice introduction to what the creators had in mind and to the message of Black Mirror. Third and fourth seasons can only be described as masterpieces. All four come with thought-provoking plots and unexpected twists. Boredom is nonexistent. Next comes the fifth season aka Black Mirror's downfall. This season brought us three episodes, they weren't necessarily bad they were very much okay but it felt like you were watching a different series entirely. The creators must have lost their initial focus. The episodes weren't filled with gore, technological advancements, ethical dilemmas, they weren't mind boggling as they once were. You didn't stare in terror or fascination. Fifth season lacked the originality and philosophy aspects that made Black Mirror remarkable. The plots were lazy, nothing crazy, each episode had a celebrity starring cause let's show our audience how much we don't care anymore, we want the money. They brought Anthony Mackie (E1), Andrew Scott (E2) and Miley Cyrus (E3) - and this is not meant to criticise the celebrities, they all did a great job -. This was a huge disappointment for me, i adored this series, i told all my friends to watch it and we discussed what we would do in those bizarre situations, my emotional friends weren't able to finish some episodes because they found them that frightening. It was amazing. And to think this series would throw all it's original initiatives for more views broke my little cinema-obsessed heart.Ending this prolonged review. 9 stars. Wish I could give it a 10 but I can't forgive the creators for the 5th season. They became what they once called out. Not only a shame, a tragedy.\n",
            "This is one of the best sci-fi shows out there! Every episode explores how some aspect of technology, while it has good intentions, can be used to ruin lives and make us further away from each other. I just love how the show integrates the tech to fit in with a great story. The stories are really engaging, enjoyable, and thrilling. I love watching how the technology becomes exploited. The show also has really deep themes: death, love, memory, and human bonding. The anthology format really works for this show. So worth it!!!\n",
            "Black mirror is a modern science fiction thriller. The show tackles topics which are scarily possible and make you question everything about the world. The concept is intriguing. I've noticed that most if not every episode starts off as a utopian fiction and all the characters look happy using the new technology. Everything seems right until the turning point. The start of every episode feels like the calm before the storm. The downfall comes after the turning point and honestly, this is the best part. The downfall shows an eerily possible reality of the world we live in. For the most part, in these downfalls, the use of the technology leads to the antagonist experiencing trauma. After each episode, personally I breathe a huge sigh of relief as I finally wake up from the illusion which is the Black Mirror episode and realise that none of this is happening to me. I would recommend this show to anyone who is looking for a science fiction thriller and is mature enough to handle the immersive, thought provoking episodes.\n",
            "Because \"Black Mirror\" is an anthology series, it is, by nature, uneven. That said, there are more good episodes than bad. There is not a single episode that doesn't make you think. This series has some of the best episodes I have ever seen on TV. Some will make you uncomfortable, others are more upbeat, but none disappoint. I have my favorites, but will just say to watch the entire series.\n",
            "\"Black Mirror\" shows the viewer every episode anew dystopian visions of the future.And I think she does it very well!With every episode you ask yourself, \"What would I do in this situation?\" and \"Is it possible that it will come to this at some point?\".Of course, everyone has their favorite episodes.Mine are:\n",
            "Fifteen Million MeritsThe Entire History of YouShut Up and DanceBlack MuseumUnfortunately, I have to say that I really didn't like season 5 and I hope that \"Black Mirror\" will return to its old character in season 6.Nevertheless, highly recommended and refreshing!!!Season 6 Update:Many say Black Mirror has lost its dystopian character with this season, but actually there is only 1 episode this season that doesn't fit into the concept of the series and that is the last \"Demon 79\" - and Demon 79 is not supposed to fit into that at all fits the basic concept of the series and is much more of a movie that could be released in the Black Mirror universe. This can also be seen at the beginning of the episode, because this episode doesn't start with the typical Black Mirror intro. According to its own statement, the episode is a \"Red Mirror film\" - so it doesn't serve under the typical Black Mirror banner.The show's creators say they've been experimenting with this season to bring something fresh and new to Black Mirror. This season wasn't well received, so it's safe to assume that season 7 (if there is one) will feel more familiar to viewers.\n",
            "Did they even provide the writers of Season 06 of Black Mirror with a brief? Or was the brief: \"go ahead and spoil an iconic sci-fi series\"?Black Mirror is a sci-fi thriller series, providing a futuristic and usually pessimistic worldview, with scenarios that rely on the frontline of utilizing technology. These dystopian uses of technology are the critical substance of the series' DNA, giving us some excellent and hugely inventive episodes, in all five seasons.Season 06 seems to be ignorant about such previous themes, suggesting episodes that deal with vampires to angels and other sort of bullcr@p! What is wrong with Netflix and its writers? Did they work on the episodes during the writers' prolonged strike? Do yourself a favour and avoid watching season 06!\n",
            "Even the \"weak\" episodes are better than most of the stuff that Hollyweird is putting out.\n",
            "This is a British sci-fi anthology television series. It takes classic series like Twilight Zone into the modern world. One of the interesting aspect is that it's a British show. Back then during streaming infancy, the show was an unknown across the pond. One had to hunt for it. It has the ability to shock but it's also British which made it a little like Masterpiece Theatre. It pushes at the envelope of what it means to be TV. It makes you think. It entertains. It's discussion worthy. It is the best of the genre.\n",
            "Black Mirror is still discussing the current problems, over entertainment, over dissemination and over memory, but the writers put their background on the future of advanced technology to increase the effect, which is very good-looking and worth pondering.\n",
            "A dystopian British series on the technological future.\n",
            "With raw moments.\n",
            "A series that shows in a dry way and without repressing it a future that could await us as humanity with the use of technology.\n",
            "Each chapter tells a different story and has nothing to do with the others. In fact in each chapter they are new characters.\n",
            "Some chapters are more sarcastic than others, some more scandalous than others.\n",
            "The script and the situations are smart.\n",
            "It raises moral and ethical norms poorly addressed in an extraordinary way.\n",
            "With fully interpretive endings that leave you thinking about the future of the species.\n",
            "The interesting thing about this series is that it does not use the Netflix formula of repeating everything.\n",
            "With 5 seasons and each one of different extension.\n",
            "The only way I watch T.V. shows nowadays is by recommendation. There are so many shows that I could be completely consumed by them all and I can guarantee that over half of them are not worth my time. I actually heard about Black Mirror from a sports radio host and thought, \"that sounds interesting.\"I watched episode one of season three and was hooked. Just as a refresher: season three ep one was titled \"Nosedive\" starring Dallas Bryce Howard. It was about a world in which ratings are currency and clout. Every individual has a rating attached to him/herself that can be seen upon viewing the person's face. Using a five star rating scale, those with a higher rating have greater privileges whereas those with lower ratings are the scourge of the Earth. It was amazing to see what people would do just to get a five star rating (not too far from our current reality). I binged watched that entire season then watched all three seasons. Just about every episode was genuinely thought provoking. These shows are extremely well done and offer so much food for thought. Each episode is replete with quality writing, quality effects and filming and quality acting. Black Mirror is a Netflix gem. It is Twilight Zone if it were rated R.\n",
            "Dangerously creepy mind and bending experience every episode. Among the greatest shows of our existence! Many great realizations that people probably don't think about. I can think of a few people that can sit through & not take in the messages that represent our very existence in a metaphorical genius true way whether with technology, traumatic series of events, mind control, illusions, or being trapped in some way, which is unfortunate for those that aren't woke!Regardless of woke or not, I'm happy this is available for people to immerse into the dark reality we live in. Sci-Fi episodes or not they have an extremely valid point to get across to the viewers. Outstanding scary good grittiness all around; will always remain in my favorites.\n",
            "This British play is really powerful. Each episode can make a big reversal of people's psychological defense line. It slowly mingles with the people in the story. At last, I feel the sadness of modern high technology, especially the kidnapping in the first episode. The irony is too dark. It lets you examine all kinds of addictions brought by yourself and modern technology. At last, it even satirizes you, and you will still take pictures Exclaimed with both hands.\n",
            "My brother put me on to this show. The latest season is the best one yet. Great show especially if you're a sci-fi tech fan.\n",
            "I have always seen Black mirror as presenting a near possible implication of the everyday technology as it is evolving. It presented the peak into the future how our lives with evolve with the technology. Season 6 is although very disappointing after such a long wait. First episode has the signature style of Black mirror and was a wonderful example of Gen AI combined with hyper personalization.However the rest of the episodes feel like some sci-fi out of 1980s mixed with psychological drama. Esp the one with the tapes in the episode 2 that is so not black mirror material. Neither the spaceship and the jealous co pilot.\n",
            "Excellent show untils the last season. Leaves you wondering after each and every episode if the technological future really is worth it or not. Would have been a 10/10 but the last season lowers the score to 9/10.\n",
            "If you don't have the time or patience for a film, Black Mirror recreates the story and twists/turns of one within an hour. As with every series ever, there are a couple of episodes that lack that certain je ne sais quoi that all the other episodes have. The minute that intro goes you know you're in for a journey and on almost every occasion it's one that is worth embarking on. The writing in every episode is superb and the creativity of ideas within the Black Mirror team never ceases to amaze. Get watching everybody!\n",
            "This TV show is truly remarkable. It has everything you could ever want in a show: compelling themes, great writing, and a captivating cast. Every episode is carefully crafted to bring out the complexities of the human experience and explore the hard social questions that we face in our society.One of the standout features of the show is how it incorporates technology into its themes. While some of the technology depicted may seem far-fetched, it's not difficult to imagine that we could be living in a world with such advanced tech in the not-too-distant future. Just take a look at the AI and drones that we already have.Watching just one episode of this show can leave you thinking about it for days. It's the kind of show that stays with you and makes you question your own beliefs and values. If you're looking for a show that will challenge you and make you think, then this is the one for you.\n",
            "This is a refreshing unique take on human obsessions in the 21st century and how it damages us to a degree . I like the different aspects of how we are shown and in a way warned about our current obsession with technology so take heed of warning to your own use of out so called necessities of today's digital world .\n",
            "This show is the most interesting series I have come across. Black mirror presents scenarios which seem like a natural progression for the trends in the world, and also for potential trends which our society is already gravitating toward, in a way that shows you the benefits but focuses more on the potential negatives which seem to elude us. I applaud the foresight of the writers who present these issues in a way that seems obvious while were watching each episode but probably have not pondered in our every day lives. This show overall seems to have the underlying message that we want all these things which we believe will better out lives but comes with a set of problems which ultimately doesn't change anything. I believe this show is meant to help us appreciate the simpler things in life or at the very least challenge the wants we believe are the most important. Either way, a very interesting show and I would recommend everyone to watch it.\n",
            "This is a brilliant show! It is extremely disturbing and at the same time ingenious. It took me a year to watch second episode as I was too in shock from the first one. However it makes you question our time, our lives and society in general. I can't compare it to anything I've seen so far. Each episode leaves you speechless and the only thing you can actually say after a while is OMG!\n",
            "My favorite TV Show of all time. It's a series of science-fiction anthologies focusing on potential ugly outcomes of technology innovation, and many of them are already about to happen. Episodes are standalone with their own original story, but they all share the main theme of how technology might affect us and reveal the hideous side of our soul. Furthermore, their typical dark and ironic tone are so exceptional, it blends in perfectly with the main theme. Besides, the anthology approach was really a great choice because it keeps the audience focused on core concept of the series while enjoying various stories rather than be attached to some recurrent characters in a standard approach. Indeed, the show has never ceased to amaze us, either with unimaginable ideas of technology, or sometime with new plot development regarding similar tech innovations but from very different angles. Like its creator - Charlie Brooker said: \"There was a signature tone to the stories, the same dark chocolate coating - but the filling was always a surprise.\" And all together, that's what has made Black Mirror stand out as an uniquely remarkable picture of our time.\n",
            "* The series's title was inspired by the cold, shiny screen of a TV, a monitors, a smart-phone... when it's off - technology's \"black mirror\" that can reflect the darkness of humanity.* Some of you might decide to abandon the series after watching the 1st episode. That's a terrible mistake! In fact, I consider it as one of the weakest stories of the collection. In my opinion, as it was a pilot, Brooker didn't want to go too deep, therefore the shocking stayed in the shallow but not in the profound. However, don't give up on the show because of it! Otherwise you'll miss some extraordinary gem that'll make you regret.\n",
            "So far, my 3 favorite stories are: 3rd - \"The Entire History of You\" (season 1); 2nd - \"Black Museum\" (season 4); and especially the 2014 Christmas special, \"White Christmas\", has been my number one ever since.\n",
            "Black Mirror tells us the stories of some normal people's life, before and after technology ruins it. This serie of mini-films are telling us that technology has cons like it has pros. Technology has to be developed carefully, otherwise it can harm more than help. This serie gives that lesson, and we should listen it.\n",
            "One of the best tv series which has complete new story in every episode. All episodes ends with an open ending which is the best part of the series.\n",
            "This makes you both entertained while you use your brain. It tales our digital world to the extreme and I just love it.\n",
            "I loved Black Mirror. Not everything was great, but mostly it was. And I enjoyed it. After seeing some bad episodes I stopped watching. I do not know which season it was.Suddenly there was season 6 so I gave it go! The first episode was ok and I had the feeling they need to align the compass a bit to find the perfect spot.But with every episode it turned into Dark Horrish Fairytales, but then with the cliche and lazy writing. The acting and shots are of a high level. The ideas can be great, but the storytelling, the choices. It is just wrong for me.Maybe the black mirror is indeed black and the creators cannot see what they are making?So I am putting Black Mirror on my ignore list. This is not my cup of tea. Or I must rewatch the first seasons maybe...\n",
            "Charlie Brooker is the Albert Einstein in scifi story writing, the Jules Verne of our time. The series is dark, ingenious and thought-provoking. Typically a series can stretch for years on a single storyline that works. The genius of Charlie Brooker is that he can come up with so many stories that are all unique and interesting. Now this replaced Mind Hunter as my favorite show on Netflix.\n",
            "I'm a huge Black Mirror fan and was extremely honoured to have taken part in one of the episodes. This shows never fails to enlighten and inform us. It's so ahead of it's time and serves as a real lesson to us, even it seems a little weird. Life is getting weird, so we better be prepared for what's ahead. Charlie Brooker is a genius.\n",
            "Very genius series, u can't watch it continuously episode after episode, u need to stop for hours or days sometimes to think about what u watched.Really excellent work 👍🏻\n",
            "I am not finished all seasons and episodes but it is enough to see first season to write some good review about this article. This extraordinary serial shows you if you are so deep into the technology how its affect you. The best of the serial is the episodes are not linked to each other. Each episodes gives you a short movie taste.\n",
            "I like Black Mirror because it is a thought-provoking and challenging show that explores the dark side of technology. The show's anthology format allows it to tackle a wide range of topics, from social media addiction to government surveillance to the dangers of artificial intelligence. Each episode is a self-contained story that leaves you thinking about the implications of the technology it presents.I also appreciate the show's dark humor. Even though the subject matter is often disturbing, Black Mirror finds ways to make you laugh at the same time. This helps to make the show more accessible and engaging, and it also serves to underscore the show's message that technology can be both a blessing and a curse.Here are some specific episodes of Black Mirror that I enjoyed:\"The Entire History of You\" (Season 1, Episode 3): This episode explores the dangers of memory implants and how they can be used to control people.\"White Bear\" (Season 2, Episode 2): This episode is a disturbing look at the nature of punishment and how it can be used to manipulate people.\"San Junipero\" (Season 3, Episode 4): This episode is a more hopeful look at the future of technology, as it explores the possibility of creating a virtual afterlife.If you're looking for a show that will make you think, I highly recommend Black Mirror. It's not for the faint of heart, but it's definitely worth watching.\n",
            "This is the perfect example oh acting, direction and story telling art. Just amazed.\n",
            "best show i've ever seenSo funny to read reviews of people who Hated it... all of them say something like \"I watched the 1st episode and...bla bla\"...indeed the 1st episode is the most scandalous of them all...maybe that's why they made it episode 1? If you don't like this, this show isn't for you...go watch breaking bad or something\n",
            "Season 6 of Black Mirror illustrates a notable resurgence of the series, thanks to Charlie Brooker's willingness to experiment with new narrative structures and themes. Its uniqueness lies in its unpredictability, keeping viewers constantly intrigued and pleasantly surprised as each episode unfolds a distinct story. A notable feature of this season is its exploration of human weakness and the integration of various genres, enriching its narrative depth. However, there seems to be a decrease in the show's prescience, although this contributes to its unpredictability. Balancing all factors, while Season 6 has a few misses and might not be as pointedly incisive as previous seasons, it is still worth watching for fans of the series, offering a fresh perspective and narrative variety.\n",
            "I am reminded that poignant and critical science fiction still holds a place in our society. No matter how advanced our world becomes I hope someone will always be holding a magnifying glass up to the people and technology that shape out daily lives. In the vein of Rod Serlings Twilight Zone, Black Mirror shows us a bleak impression of the future if we succumb to the immediate gratification of technology and cynicism. Each Black Mirror episode is it's own stand alone piece. I'm not going to do a breakdown of the episodes. They are all worth checking out. Just trust me when I say it's some of the best Sci-Fi I've seen in a long, long time. REAL Sci-Fi. There aren't any happy endings here. It's Beautiful, It's sad, and it's all probably going to happen.Watch it, enjoy it, and be wary of the future.\n",
            "I found this series extraordinary. It made me feel like I did very young when seeing The Twilight Zone for the first time...a world like ours, but tilted slightly, an engaging story and often a twist at the end. Should you find the subject matter the first episode to be a bit too much, I would suggest skipping it. However, it is a terrific episode and well worth viewing. All of the stories include a tweak in the current world, often in the nature of technology. Be Back Soon has elements of romance to it, while other episodes are more thriller or political in nature. They all belong together but each have their own feel. There are cameos by characters in one episode in others, but it's done as a fun thing to spot, not meant to illuminate the stores, which is why this is definitely episodic in nature. Highly recommended.\n",
            "absolutely gripping intelligent humorous insight into modern culture with a media savi team of writers.Well worth a watch for the will he won't he suspense of the first episode.make some time in your schedule to see this and look forward to discussing it with people afterwards.Looking forward to this writing team coming back with more funds to deliver bigger and better.the ten lines of text minimum is a real pain when you are in a hurry to watch the next episode.enjoy.\n",
            "Watched through all seasons.\n",
            "Some episodes were quite good, but most of them were mediocre at most.\n",
            "I loved the idea of everything being so advanced in terms of technology, but that was about it.\n",
            "The stories are pretty meh, and the acting is pretty meh in most of them as well.Would I recommend this series to a friend? No, I would not.\n",
            "This is truly an amazing show. At this point I have watched the first three episodes and have been brought to tears by each one. The issues that the show grapples with and illuminates in each episode are timely and significant. To say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison.\n",
            "Black Mirror has always been able to extrapolate a dark future based on the most pressing current threats. This season took extreme loneliness, unprocessed grief, dissociations, schizophrenia, etc. & dramatized them into literal depictions. I certainly miss the sci-fi dystopian storytelling aspects, but arguably, much of that has already materialized in reality (AI is here in all its Black Mirror glory). So, I think they focused on the most human threat we face now, mental health crisis, and I'm all for it!It may seem like a detour from previous seasons, but once you appreciate the nuances of the underlying metaphors, it's pretty badass. Black Mirror reflects how the world has become a desensitized ecosystem lacking compassion, driven by success, fame, or money, most times out of sheer survival necessity. That empathy-seeking grief is driving many \"corruptible\" minds into dark, irreversible actions, especially in the scarcity of healing resources.It shifts from its usual narrative but truly reflects our dark society. Also, the few throwbacks were pretty cool!\n",
            "Upon viewing the first episode I wasn't sure how the show was going to progress. Alas, the second episode is a completely different story. \"Black Mirror\" repeatedly and perfectly depicts what the future may hold for us as people of the world if we continue to increase our dependence and reliance on technology and social media respectively. As I believe the title is intended to foreshadow, it shows us a dark reflection of ourselves. The show eloquently brings to light how future technologies can make our lives immensely better, but as history has shown us, and as is depicted in the show, immensely better can easily become immensely problematic.As for my taste in shows, I appreciate developed characters and plot randomness or unpredictability. Charlie Brooker I applaud thee because the characters are consistently fully developed and you can never pin down where the episodes are going to go. The character development leads you to easily empathize with the various situations the series puts them in, and by the end of the episodes you'll find yourself evaluating their decisions as if they were you're close friends.Brilliant execution, use of technology, and plot development - simply brilliant.\n",
            "Episode two is the most profound artistic statement I've ever seen on any medium. The monologue by the dude at the end is probably the best bit of acting I've ever seen. Next level S#!t. I was going to leave this review at that but IMDb says it must be a minimum of 10 lines. All I can say is this show is truly visionary and probably too far ahead of it's time for a lot of people to really appreciate. People who are looking for something new, unique, interesting, thought provoking, disturbing, intelligent, spectacular, sensational, prophetic, well executed, superbly written, directed, and performed, will enjoy this program. The first episode was one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen on film, but was so well done and engaging I couldn't look away... or sleep afterward. The second episode just takes filmmaking to a whole new level. The third episode doesn't let up and is brilliant in it's own way. I haven't gotten to the second season yet, but I've seen enough to easily give it ten stars.\n",
            "Black Mirror has been by far, my favorite series in decades comparable only to The Twilight Zone and of course, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. Black Mirror managed to surpass BOTH for me which is no small feat, combining both sci-fi and mystery with an ongoing theme of strange curiosity that evokes both imagination and emotion. I found myself quite literally on the edge of my seat with each and every episode, ruminating over each episode that graced my screen after watching and anxiously anticipating the next episode - and series - with disappointment and feeling a great void when they were over. This was true with each and every episode from series 1 through series 4. I am still ranking this series as a whole an 8 out of 10 which would have been a strong 10 without reservation had it not been for series 5. Now, we reach series 5 and I'm more confused than disappointed. I'll explain...\n",
            "While there have been only 3 episodes thus far in the 5th season, they all seem to have an ongoing theme of absurdity. Well, almost uselessness. The 1st episode is interesting but way too far-fetched and predictable than remotely possible which is the key element in what creates good mystery and sci-fi in the first place. This episode, it's just silliness. And, if you happen to have strong core values you may want to view this before showing it to your children. Even my husband who is a die-hard sci-fi addict found it not only absurd but revolting, just FYI, and we are absolutely open-minded and accepting of alternative lifestyles and views. The second episode is a regurgitated lesson from back in 2010 and is equally predictable. The 3rd episode is definitely sci-fi approved however there was way under zero mystery and was more predictable than the first 2 episodes. I will say though, that the addition of the altered 90's lyrics from 25 years ago was a nice touch. It's as though they shoved Charlie Brooker (who I admire greatly) into a closet and said \"You have 3 days, come up with 3 episode stories.\" They're terrible. And, to a certain degree they have all been done before. I won't mention how or where as this would create spoilers. The directing was awful. So, what happened?\n",
            "The best seasons of the show are long in the past. Seasons 2 - 4 when it was still pretty much British were the amongst the most compelling, interesting, shocking and thought provoking. Then season 5 happened and it's been going downhill ever since with less and less quality. I hope season 7 is its last so BM can maintain some dignity as it goes out rather than going down the GoT last season complete mess.Season 1 - 6 Stars : A good start if you can get past episode 1.Season 2, 3, 4 - 9 Stars : Very few misses here! This is penultimate BM.Season 5 - 3 Stars : What the hell!?Season 6 - 5 Stars : Middling and only one real standout episode.\n",
            "Season 1 to 4 is one of the most creative, innovative shows of all time. Season 5 is a downhill with no creativity at all and weak story line.\n",
            "Many TV shows have attempted to explore our near future but none have done it with the level of intricacy, creativity and sheer frightfulness of Charlie Brooker's dystopian masterpiece.\n",
            "Brooker has created a virtuous science fiction drama anthology. This series has outstanding direction, writing, cinematography, special effects, custome, settings, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast deliver bravura realistic performances and includes the likes of Howard, Hamm, Plemons, Kaluuya, John-Kamen, Atwell, Flynn and many more stellar artists. The series is a tapestry of futuristic and modern-day stand alone tales that are thrilling, perplexing, crisp and full of satire. Using technology as a source of paranoia, the stories explore the collective anxious state of mind of the world. Each story features it's own cast of prodigious and mystifying characters. The plots for each episode are clever, unique, thought provoking, insightful, duplicitous, cathartic and have stunning endings. It's a refreshing look at how technology can turn on society when in today's world people feel like they're missing out on or aren't part of something bigger if they're not participating in some form of social media. The series also scrutinizes technology turning on itself, humans using technology to turn on eachother and humans using technology to turn on themselves. This is a one of a kind, captivating, mesmorizing and memorable series. I look forward to viewing what the series has in store for next season.\n",
            "There's not much to say about this show other than its a really unique masterpiece, showing the decay of society covered by pretended smile and ignorance. How even morale persons under the influence of rotten society rules go on the dark path of egoism. The incredible accuracy of how people with different characters will behave in certain situation is what stands out most in this series. Stand alone episodes about the consequences and the power of technology. Quite possibly situations that will happen in the future. The acting in this show is superb!I highly recommend it to people who enjoy understanding todays society and are worried of the direction this world is taking. And the acting in this show is superb!\n",
            "Black Mirror is one of the best shows currently on TV. The updated Twilight Zone-style show blends twisted reality with technology in the near future. Each episode from season 1-4 is easily watchable and at least very good, while many episodes are brilliant. Sometimes the twist isn't at the end...but at the beginning or the middle...it always keeps you on your toes and delivers. You find yourself saying, \"I could see that happening within the next 5-10 years.\" And some of the plot lines are starting to drift into reality today. Black Mirror seasons 1-4 are a must watch.Then there is the fifth season. Do not bother. Each show is terrible. The stories get ridiculous, are pointless, or have characters you just do not care about. Like too much in Hollywood these days diversity was put ahead of story the episode called Striking Vipers. It has an LGBT storyline...that isn't really LGBT...and doesn't seem to know what to do with itself other than check off a box for an LGBT theme. They weren't willing to go where it needed to go or just thought virtual reality sex would be enough to make it interesting...it does not. Check out the earlier episode, San Junipero for a brilliant LGBT storyline that works on all levels. Episode 2 in season 5 is completely forgettable. And episode 3 with Miley Cyrus attempts to make you feel sorry for vacuous pop stars but instead makes you hate them all the more. Season 5 seemed mailed in without much effort.Season 6 needs to be a great improvement or the show could lose viewers. Watch seasons 1-4...skip season 5 altogether.\n",
            "Incredible show seasons 1 through 4 were amazing season 5 was herorific\n",
            "... it died :(. I m sticking with 8 stars because the original premise was great but it changedThe first few seasons were crazy and weird. You got the sense it was silly but saw signs of the reality in life coming to fruition in society!It was so unique and shocking but made you think on how the world is changing so quickly and what the consequences could be for the future. Has social media changed to the detriment of young people? Do we love someone so much, we would be willing to sacrifice reality over illusions? Would we be willing to sacrifice decency for vulgarity just to feel victorious?Only the watcher can decide.\n",
            "So as weird as it may sound I only just got into watching BM, I had heard of it but just never gotten around to it I guess, but with everything going on I have been watching them but not binge watching cuz they are very heavy and dark and leave you leaving disturbed. However despite that I'm sure I don't have to tell anyone just how brilliant it is now having seen most of the episodes. As I said this show us on par with the godfather of anthology shows TZ and I think if Rod Serling was alive today this is these are the kinds of stories he would write i think. Charlie Brooker is a genius writer who really has a grasp on where we are and where we are heading with technology and all the good and really bad that can come with it. In Hated in The Nation that one really showed the bad of pack mentality and the vicious jerks people can be in social media, I only rarely use FB, and the that one really hit home for me. So If you are looking for something to watch with absolutely brilliant writing, acting, cinematography and plot twists you will never see coming do yourself a favor and watch Black Mirror.\n",
            "This is must watch sci fi series n full of surprises n thrill\n",
            "Most of the Episodes are fantastic, some are not as Good\n",
            "Black mirror reflects. Thank you Netflix for being the source of this discovery. I have watched many episodes more than once and each time i get more out of it. I am not writer and not a critic but only a viewer and I would like to thank the creator (s) for this series. I registered on IMDb to write this note. Congratulations for San Junipero Emmy's win. It is beyond deserved! I was so happy when i heard the winning news! San Junipero is a story that will stay with me forever. Black mirror may be dark for some viewers, but the scripts and scenarios are so close to our present and future reality that it is hard to look away, and often in the most intriguing ways. Sorry my English is second to me but you get the point:-) I am looking up for the next season! Glad shows like yours exist.Truly.\n",
            "So far this show doesn't dissapoint. There were a few stories that took a little while to get into, like the dating episode which left me feeling both happy and a bit disturbed.But not nearly as bad as Black Museum or Crocodile (da hell was wrong with that woman!).I found MetalHead to be the least like the rest of the stories, maybe because of the black and white footage or just the bleak landscape it shows. I still found it highly entertaining. Black Mirror's worst episode is better than a lot of series finales imo.\n",
            "This series is just great. Season 5 gets a lot of hate, but I see where Charlie Brooker was going for. Because what is more interesting: an episode about some sort of obvious dangerous and killing piece of technology, or an episode about different aspects of technology that we already know, but just with some subtle twists or different perspectives? Episodes that don't tell you what to think, but LET you think. Episodes that don't scream \"technology is awful\" but tell a story about... people. People and technology. That's what season 5 delivers.\n",
            "Can't quite remember ever watching a series where each one hour episode left such a powerful impression. Loved it.\n",
            "It's just that good! I really like how it is an anthology series so the episodes are completely unrelated. You can literally watch the last episode and not spoil anything! Just pop it on netflix read the synopsis and choose the one you want to watch depending on the mood you are in. Extremely good show! Very addicting and very well thought out! The actors all do a terrific job! The directing is on-par. The cinematography, breath-taking, the color palette... Everything. This show is extremely DARK, I can not stress this enough, you never know what you are in for... It takes you on one hell of a ride and doesn't let up! I can not believe I slept on it. Possibly the best show on Netflix, highly addicting and Highly recommended! 5 stars +\n",
            "In turn, it is the best. There is a lot of weakness in some parts.\n",
            "A mix between sci-fi, thriller, drama and sarcastic comedy depicting a possible future and sometimes the very present moment of our society. The evolution and possibles scenarios of the merging between humans and technology.\n",
            "I love this series\n",
            "I'm glad, I came across this. Just shows, you don't need 3 hrs of runtime to occupy a viewer's thoughts and entertain all the same\n",
            "Perfect edge of the seat stuff. The pilot just sold it. I had never imagined anything like the pilot would come on screen one day.\n",
            "If you don't like any episode you can just switch to another. It's that simple. Just give it 15 mins to set it up though\n",
            "The depth that British drama can explore is really unmatched by other industries. The power of the media, the will of the public, and the erosion of consumerism brought about by advanced technology have fallen into the past. Each episode is wonderful and worth pondering.\n",
            "Black Mirror is without a doubt one of the best television shows to come out of Netflix within the 2010's decade, but what makes this show-stopping must watch different from the others?Well for starters, black mirror doesn't just touch the surface, it dives straight into inquisitive storylines that keep audience members on their toes the entire time, and creates it's own universe of futuristic storytelling with intelligent depictions of the future world with technology's massive influence. No two mirror black mirror episodes are the same, but the creators of each episode themselves link every episode together through its overarching themes of technology and it's effect on the future world.Along with Black Mirror's A-list starring cast beginning from Miley Cyrus all the way to Jon Hamm and Daniel Kaluuya from horror blockbuster 'Get Out', Black Mirror isn't shy about what it's intentions are, and it really is a refreshing take on a universal series. It rarely ever missing the mark, and never fails to keep audience members entertained while binge watching on a week night.\n",
            "Boomers love to talk about how great their TV shows where like the Twilight Zone and Outer Limits but I think we have them beat with Westworld and Black Mirror. In Black Mirror we get to see issues that bother us right now being explained like having to earn social credits. I'm sorry but that worries me.\n",

            "I loved it until season 4\n",
            "Seasons 1-4 are fantastic and a must see. Bandersnatch was very interesting. These 4 seasons are on society and human condition.\n",
            "On its own, season 5 is watchable. Compared to the previous seasons however, it's waste.\n",
            "Last season was not as expected but Miley episode was so much fun idk why people are hating on it. Maybe they are jealous or something idk but just the season i am disappointed with the rest its an awesome and must watch series\n",
            "We need more of this kind of shows where every episode tells a different story that is interesting and original!!!\n",
            "This show has become rather hysterical and lacks the salient social/technological insight it used to offer.It's basically a giant mess now. Sure, the acting is still good enough but there everything seems over the top. This pilot episode - National Anthem - was a fully extreme episode but it was well-crafted and resonated with something deeply flawed at the core of modern life. I'm comparison to that episode, season 6 is predictable, hysterical and, to be honest, the season feels lazy.That's all I have to say. Simply running up the character count now. Meow meow meow woof laser hands. Pew pew.\n",
            "Black Mirror is, first of all, SF (this is for all of the other reviewers saying that it s unrealistic). Second, the episodes are not made or thought to be masterpieces by their acting or dialogs or even effects . They catch the simplicity of a normal lifetime moment but with the dark immersion of future(maybe!) technology. It's the underlined ideas that are important here. All the other elements are basic ON PORPOISE so you can focus on all the consequences our future choices can bring. And to be honest, where in the world have you seen full on perfectly serious played drama with mindblown visual and whatever effects for a SATYR!?.\n",
            "Last but not least, some of the actions of the humanity are disgusting, horrific, and repulsive. Some is a way too small and insignificant word for this actually. I don't understand how SOME of you are so surprised.All in all, whoever's reading this, i advice you to give it a try if this is what you were willing to do and please, watch more than 1 episode. If you ask me, start with White Christmas (episodes are individual).\n",
            "The show does a good job with slow buildup and engaging the audience. They move their audience to a different world and makes them understand the power and admire the capabilities of technology. A good show that makes you question technology and human beings.\n",
            "If you usually like sci_fi and thriller show. So no doubt this series for you. In that series you'll watch newly concept on science fiction. Each Episode is deferent to other episode so don't be confuse. Black mirror one of the finest sci_fi series I have ever see.\n",
            "I've just discovered the extraordinary showstopper, \"Black Mirror\", a British sci-fi television series that is part \"Twilight Zone\" but darker and more bizarre. In six episodes in Season One we are let into a dystopian future narratively thrilling yet outrageous, because of its plausibility. Each episode, like \"Twilight Zone\", has a separate story and a different cast. You can view the episodes in any order. More a short story collection than a novel, \"Black Mirror\" is less a dystopia than it is the dark side of life and the darkest regions of the mind. Read the entire review at: www.unhealedwound.com under the December 29, 2014 post: \"Black Mirror\"--\"Dark Reflections of the Mind.\"\n",
            "Its an obvious 10/10. No ep has ever disappointed me. Each ep is so well written and unique. It brings us face to face with the reality of the society which we live in. It exposes our mentality towards each other and warns us about the future. I have never seen a scifi show this good. U can also watch love death robots after this. It is also good, but not better than this, and more random. But black mirror is a MUST WATCH for scifi lovers.\n",
            "Ok, I know I'm late to this party but you might be too & looking for something truly exciting, smart & weird to stream (each episode like an exquisite film), you gotta check this out. I've never been a big sci-fi fan but this is something different: a Twilight Zone for the 21st Century. Pretty much the best thing we've seen on Netflix, an original series w/ the BBC. Charlie Brooker rules.\n",
            "After this show, life is complete. Now I can have a whole new breed of nightmares. Absolutely Amazing! Brilliantly done. There is nothing else like it.\n",
            "I never expected this kind of a brilliant work in the form of a series. Especially, the white Christmas special episode, so far the best of all. This series shows how technology can be used to help a man or make his life miserable. Though it contains some dystopian view, it surely is a warning to people who thinks technology as their salvation.\n",
            "Whoever's behind the scripts are geniuses.\n",
            "It was disturbing sometimes, which wasn't bad thing for me, because I was ready for taking any kind of thing.It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology.It's one of the best series of the last years due this uniqueness. Since is treating and telling story and problems about the actual or near future society and the dark side of technology you have to consider that every single episode is a reflection and meditation starting point that most of the time can let the viewer with a sad sensation or let with a bitter taste.Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world.\n",
            "One of the best dark comedies. Must watch show.... Would make you think how we are losing yourself...All episodes with different story line.. Commendable work ...\n",
            "One of the most captivating aspects of \"Black Mirror\" is its ability to capture the essence of contemporary concerns and fears about the rapid advancement of technology. The show isn't afraid to explore uncomfortable and sometimes disturbing scenarios, forcing viewers to confront the potential consequences of our digital age. It's a modern-day Twilight Zone that challenges us to question the ethical, moral, and social implications of our technological choices.The writing in \"Black Mirror\" is exceptionally sharp and thought-provoking.

Whether you're a fan of science fiction or simply interested in exploring the complexities of human existence, \"Black Mirror\" offers a captivating journey into the uncharted territories of our digital world.\n",
            "It is one of the series that I considered a masterpiece. I have passed everything. I have to congratulate the screenwriter separately. What kind of imagination is he? In each chapter, there are different facts and system criticisms that you will learn from. There are some episodes in particular that, if they were published as a movie rather than a series episode, they would easily find a place in the IMDb top 100. It seemed unfair to me that they published it as a serial part :) It is one of the rare series that I watch without missing a second of it.\n",
            "As a Black Mirror Major Fan I long awaited season 5. One the best shows on cable with only a few sub par episodes. Smithereens is not one of them it is one of the best Mirrors ever. Andrew Scott our favorite from Mystery was outstanding. Edge of the seat with emotional depth and a dig on Facebook to boot. I know if your a Mirror Fan you don't need to read this to the others just start with this one and you will be back for more. Rich\n",
            "The depth that English drama can explore is really beyond the reach of other industries. The power of media, public will, and consumerism brought about by advanced technology erode and sink into the past. Each episode is wonderful and worth pondering.\n",
            "This is so unusual. Writer really thinks outside the box. Some episodes have been good. Others have been \"effing wow\" from my point of view. I really enjoyed the series and look forward to the next (please hit us with another 6 episodes! I felt robbed by the latest series that only had 3!). Its creepy. Imaginative. And damn right scary in some senses! Well done Charlie you dark angel!\n",
            "I can't stress how good this series is. From the very first episode it just hooks you. Every episode is different which is brilliant. You will never get bored. This series makes you assess the world around you. A lot of what is depicted is happening now and you can imagine some of the other stories coming true eventually. I have seen all the episodes including 2018 and I just hope they will continue to make more.\n",
            "From the opening shots in episode one you can tell this is a stylish yet very different take on television. The ideas and issues raised by Black Mirror make for a very intelligent viewing experience. The show tackles the implications and changes in human behavior related to the rise of new technology and media, it definitely lingers with you long after the closing credits. I have never seen anything similar. Each season contains only three episodes but this is a very real case of quality over quantity. I cant recommend this enough, if you haven't seen any work from creator Charlie Brooker you are in for a real treat. I look forward too see what ideas are install for the remaining episodes. My advise to a new viewer to the show would be the less you know going into it the better just sit back and enjoy the ride.\n",
            "There are very few movies or shows that have me glued to the screen, waiting breathlessly for the next scene. Black Mirror is one of them. Each episode is completely different but the casting is spot on each time and the story lines are brilliantly written and brought to life. I found the technological theme very thought provoking. There are small details that contribute to the feeling that the episode could happen to us at any time, now or in the future. Even the futuristic episode (episode two out of the three I have watched) seemed not only plausible but probable, in one way or another. Fitness as a requirement for making their version of money? In our society obsessed with shape, weight and size? Absolutely!!Curse my job that needs me to be present int he morning, I would stay up to watch the entire series in a heartbeat!\n",
            "only thing I should to say is it perfect, and I still stay for 3rd season. this series inspired for her movie and shown our feature life. Black Mirror is a British television anthology series created by Charlie Brooker that shows the dark side of life and technology. The series is produced by Zeppotron for Endemol. Regarding the programe's content and structure, Brooker noted, \"each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality. But they're all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy. On 9 January 2014, Charlie Brooker announced the third series of the show, confirming at least two more episodes\n",
            "Black Mirror is an anthology series that taps into our collective unease with the modern world, with each stand-alone episode a sharp, suspenseful tale exploring themes of contemporary techno-paranoia. The problem however, is that on some of the episodes, the writers desire to invocate twisted endings that convolute what starts out as a suspenseful tale, falls flat to any possible logic that would leave the viewer satisfied. Still, most of the episodes do succeed with a satisfying ending. 8/10 from me\n",
            "Hello,To those of you with an IQ over 120 and with an education, imagination and not enslaved in a unhealthy religion that warps your mind....you will love it. Episodes that force the viewer to think and accept what the future might bring (and its not very nice)!But to those of you giving this one star and wasting time with negativity and words pulled from your thesaurus, just give up and go away. Its obvious you don't have the imagination to follow this. Just a guess...how many novels (Sci_Fi, Speculative or classic) do you read a year? If the number is under 25 I weep for you. So much to learn before we die yet some waist time on sofa sports, drinking, and never traveling OUT of the US to see the world. Its sad that you praise a country that rates a movie \"X\" for kissing a breast and \"R\" for cutting it off with a chainsaw.So check this series, its a breath of fresh air.\n",
            "Season 1 of Britain's \"Black Mirror\" (2011) was absolutely terrific. (To be clear, this first \"season\" consists of only three episodes, although subsequent seasons have more.) This looks to be a truly superb dystopian science fiction anthology series — I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.I'd point to two qualities that make this show stellar. First, it's truly smart stuff. The story devices are thoughtfully invented and quite original. (These are \"near-future\" -type sci-fi tales depicting how new technology or cultural trends can have unforeseen consequences.) This show doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence, it relies on him or her to pay attention and think.Second, the writers here have a firm grasp of genuine psychological horror. There are no radioactive monsters in the sewers here, or killer robots from the future — but \"Black Mirror\" manages to be scary without those things. It does just fine presenting the viewer with visions of human shame, fear, jealousy or existential loss. These are stories that deal primarily with the psychology of their characters — and they truly get under your skin.This is great stuff — I'd recommend it.\n",
            "Could be the best series of the century! Each episode is so unique! A definite 10/10!\n",
            "It's pretty evident by season 5 that Charlie Brooker has nothing to do with the show anymore and is just there in name only.Season 1 is a must watch despite the low budget. Season 2 is fantasticly shot and give us a few classics. By season 3 they are raking in the money and investing it in making the show larger and better. Sadly by season 4 you can start to feel that something went terribly wrong and......From season 5 onwards however, the infernal woke messaging machine is at play - a crew that has given up, sold out and packed up.It's pretty evident that if there is a message here it's that Netflix does ruin everything.Sad.\n",
            "It's one of the best series I've ever watched. There were excellent episodes, there were also good episodes. Sometimes it's bad :)\n",
            "Thing that strikes me about this show is that everything they show in every episode is possible in real life... the technology and the outcomes etcMind blowing and I think educational.\n",
            "The third season didn't follow the feel of the previous seasons. I would rate the first two seasons a 9 and the last a 7 being generous. The last season was like preaching homosexuality, I'm not hating on anyone but no thanks. It turned a cutting edge science fiction series into something completely different. I was really bummed out.\n",
            "Some episodes of these series are amongst the most brilliant television ever.As each episode stands completely on their own you don't have to watchb them in order.Most of the you can qualify under horror or science fiction, both not my cup of tea normally. But these movies ('cause that is what they are, middle-short movies) bring the genres to a new level.Mostly. Of course they are not all of the same genius quality but they keep a certain standard.When I just hear about them I binged the 4 seasons then available in some days. Don't. It's too alienating. People with unstable minds can get psychotic reactions.What makes them so great, and now I'm talking about the science fiction aspect, is that about aliens or stupid space chases. It's about now. They use the technologie now available but sometimes (luckilily) not yet integrated in our lives.Sometimes it's about more future technology, or fantasy events but it's most of the times on a subtle way, not big special effects and brainless action. It always has a creepy, crazy, psychological twist.I can go on praising these series but I would say; watch!!!Absolutely recommended.Thet just aired the 6th season, I saw 3 from the 6 episodes and wow!!!\n",
            "Despite the interesting nature of this unique series, I cannot deny the despair disappointment and fear that I feel after watching each episode. For this reason I will characterize it by the word \"impressive\".This show depicts a bitter, dark and scary picture of near future or even the present time.It shows the dark and cruel aspect of over growing technology, media and globalizing social (virtual)media as it expands its shadow and run it's roots under the skin of our souls.Aside from the strong acting, what adds to the brilliance of the stories, is keeping the audience excited and enthusiastic up to the very last few minutes of the each episode, before the real story unravels.\n",
            "The episodes that are done right, are top tier. The ideas for the episodes are second to none. The characters in most episodes are interesting, the Acting is very good. It's a fantastic show.\n",
            "Really a fantastic show. Great stories made even greater by the addition of well known actors and actresses in some of the roles. Love how this show isn't afraid to broach even the most taboo of subjects and actors who aren't afraid to take on the roles and subject matter that will ultimately only boost their careers. Unlike people of the past most of us have learned that just because an actor plays a role it doesn't mean they are that kind of person in real life. As a result, we can enjoy seeing them in many different roles in many different lights and appreciate this show for what it is. An incredible work of art.\n",
            "The frightening truths behind technology in a not so far future, in my opinion. You can definitely see there are briliant minds behind this show and it got better and better with each episode. Some were unbearable to watch for a person like me who fells the movie, if you know what I mean. But yet, perfect! Disturbing and intriguing in the same time. A great balance between horror, science fiction and misters. Such a pleasure to watch them All! Please make more of it!🙏\n",
            "I've been a huge fan of the series. Until I watched the new season. I had to stop several times for the last seasons because sometimes I got overwhelmed, and this time I did stop but because it was so boring. It's just boring and some episodes like Loch Henry don't even feel like \"black mirror\" stuff. Super disappointing...\n",
            "I would say Joan Is Awful is easily better than others though. It's like the only Black Mirror episode you can expect.I think the beauty of the series is that you get to think what the meaning of \"black mirror\" is. It can be the black screen of your monitor, phones, device, etc. But this season...I don't even know.\n",
            "This show is one of the best tv shows that I have ever seen it's soo realistic great directing great actors grreeaattt writing\n",
            "They say ''ignorance is a bliss'', what if we show you what you have ignored? this is basically the theme of black mirror, it describes the bitter truth of life. I promise you...if this show doesn't make you depressed, then i don't know what else will do.\n",
            "Black mirror is just brilliant. Awesome and a fine blend of sci fi, drama and technologies. Stories are compelling, thrilling and surely keeps you glued. I was surprised by the first season, then binge watched the rest of the season. After season 3 it went downhill. Even season 4 was good to a extent but it completly faded away in season 5. But stiill I would not restrict myself to give this series a 8.\n",
            "When I first heard about \"Black Mirror\", I learned that each episode was its own story. Having now watched the first two seasons - I'm currently on the third - I can say that the connection is technology. How will technology evolve and what will we use it for, given how we now do things?It's one of the most impressive and disturbing shows. The technology evolution is less of an Orwell thing than a \"2001\" thing: the technology gets too smart for us. We invented so many things to convenience ourselves, but it eventually grew more powerful than us, and came to dominate the world.All in all, this is like few things that you've ever seen. Definitely check it out.\n",
            "I think calling Black Mirror SciFi is a bit offensive but technically it is indeed made of fictional stories on how science may evolve.Unlike other shows, this is essentially a collection of short movies, but each one succeeds in being very compelling, thought provoking and often has a thriler edge to it.So it is a drama, thriller and satire all rolled into one. Which is what it makes it so good.Basically Black Mirror premise is to dive into (very plausible) scenarios into where technological progress may lead us if we are not careful, and just how f-ed of a world we may end up with it.Would recommend watching all of the episodes, and it is a perfect show to watch if you feel like watching something but maybe do not have time to watch a movie, while still getting that beggining, middle and end feeling - and most likely will be very philosophical after that.Strong 9/10\n",
            "Black Mirror is a unique and differentiated series, with independent episodes and stories that break your expectation.\n",
            "This series is a work of art. You may find some of the series boring, but at the end there is such wisdom that you will not find anywhere except \"Black Mirror\". Best: Black Museum, Hated in the Nation, USS Calister, Bandersnatch, Smithereens (yes, 100% reality), The Entire History of You, White Christmas. Very real: Joan is Awful, Mazy day (how the media works and happiness because of someone else's tragedy), Nosedive (already exists in China. Probably elsewhere). Dangerous modern technologies that are slowly becoming a part of our lives. In this series, you will see people who could be any of us - how many give up their principles and lose their selves in exchange for benefits.\n",
            "This show is fantastic. Really well thought out way of showing tech in the near to far future. I love it and im a tech fanatic. Well worth the watch!\n",
            "The fourth season of Black Mirror manages to keeep terrifying its viewers with the similar horrors from the last season. All six stories are interesting and engaging, but some stories might get lost by the end of the episodes. Overall, a very well done season.\n",
            "If you haven't watched Black Mirror yet... well you definitely should! Black Mirror is a series full of action. Every episode in this Netflix series pulls you into a whole new world you've never seen before. Every episode is very distinct from each other, each episode has a lesson that reflects to our lies today and the scenes are incredibly clever and creative The futuristic technology creates scenes that will have you hooked! These episodes aren't only incredibly designed but the main idea to every episode id so unique... something you could never image yourself. This series has you predicting the ending throughout the whole episode. Though they can be rather confusing at first, they only make for an even more eventful ending. MY personal favorite episode is Nosedive! I was clever and eye opening...I loved it! This series is freaking awesome! It won't disappoint, I promise!\n",
            "Viewers expecting a gleeful, feel-good television show will not find one in Charlie Brooker's \"Black Mirror\", a technology centric Netflix series drenched in disturbing realities, social commentary and possible near-future outcomes. It is also a brilliantly-written anthology that serves as a 21st century Twilight Zone of sorts. Each season builds around several aspects of modern tech and how we humans may abuse them and how that tech may haunt us come a few decades. Yes, there have been one or two letdowns over the show's four year run, but all of them address key issues regarding modern day life and societal flaws, always remaining relevant and connected in some way. It's intimate and mature portrayal of people's lives affected by rogue tech is often disturbing, but thought-provoking and logical nevertheless. Its a pessimistic, often times depressing viewing, but its so effectively brought to life and so authentic, that it makes you think... a lot.\n",
            "I rated this show a 10, but without season 5... it's sad when a show this good goes bad. It was interesting and new, the concept and ideea was intriguing and thrilling to watch. Please bring back the old Black Mirror, i was looking forward to seeing the new season, but it's not worth it. Don't ruin it please, it was so good... we don't have much interesting shows to watch\n",
            "This series changed my view that how I used to see everything. Every day every moment a lot of things happening around us. Those simple little things aren't simple at all. Some times those things can make huge difference in your life.\n",
            "Literally don't even try to binge watch all episodes in a day or two really u will get a kind-of shock and unsettle feeling,some people say its very dark i say watch Dora the explorer instead.Literally whole series has like 22 episodes or so every episode is very unique and brilliantly crafted each and every aspects in it is literally mind-blowingly great,Music was phenomenal.the intro was like unsettle and dark indicating whats all this about,the song of \"who knows what love is\" is amazing and kind-of thing to tie all episodes in same universe it was a awesome song.the acting in each episode it iconic,the best episode in whole series is The white Christmas it was pure brilliant and shocking episode.the weak not worst episode is waldo moment as per me,the detailed and pure shocking episode would be Black museum,the tech's and gadgets thing and the unsettling way human brain uses it and all it was literally awesome from start,the starting episode is enough to grab the interest,Overall this series is Dark as hell it was philosophically,mentally/psychologically challenging it was thought provoking and self questioning,sometimes it was lite minded and good with nostalgia and sometimes it was ground-breaking,brain-teasing,mind-blowing,shocking,surprising and great,literally words can't describe such TV show it is Pure Art it was DARK,challenging and literally A Masterpiece,The greatest Anthology series about tech in future period!A Must watch!\n",
            "The premise to Black Mirror is not too dissimilar to The Twilight Zone. Each episode has its own unique characters fight against some form of technology. The Twilight Zone focused on the moral goodness and hope for humanity while Black Mirror can be far more depressing and reflect the negative tendencies of society.My favorite aspect of the series is the negative effects of technology. I don't think that has been a part of conversation in society, but it is true. Netflix's recent documentary The Social Dilemma highlights this, but Black Mirror takes this concept forward. There is so much we don't understand about our existence and our place in the world: our existence, extraterrestrial life or the unknown effects of greenhouse gasses that are rapidly causing climate change. We keep discovering and exploring, but at a certain point we have to realize we need to stop.This is the focal message of Black Mirror: understanding the negative effects of technology and of human nature. I think this show was needed before the pandemic to wake people, to make them realize technology and people have faults. I do not think something like this is needed at this time, it will most likely just make our current situation feel more depressing.I am optimistic about the existence of humanity. We need to learn from our mistakes and realize the massive potential we have to cause our extinction through technology or other means. Technology is painted as something that causes humans to be cruel, which is true just not to the degree portrayed in the show. Certain episodes seem to display technology as a way to be cruel and mask or expose their insecurities. Charlie Brooker is a complete genius because every episode captures these feelings no matter the different technologies used.I love the show even though it can be slightly depressing depending on the episode. I highly suggest to skip the first episode about the British PM, it scarred me for months before I could watch any other episode. Brooker has a real message behind every single one of his episodes and that is why I love watching them. Maybe season 5 was not his best work, but I am excited to see how this pandemic has inspired him to create innovating, daring stories going forward! Please watch this show, it is definitely worth your time!\n",
            "MUST WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! Every episode is really unique and full of suspense. It is so engaging and wonderful experiance is guaranteed...It should have continued with more episodes.\n",
            "Definitely waiting for more! had a great suspense and good way of connecting episodes in last episode of season 4\n",
            "A brilliant 'what if' tv show that holds, no pun intended, a black mirror to society.\n",
            "EPICIf you like unique narratives that will play on every emotion... this is the show for you\n",
            "I request the makers to please make more episodes. What the hell how come they think like that. Such a original thinking. Just hands off to you guys. \n",

            "Can't remember any other show left me so speechless like this one. There are many great shows, but this one...every single episode left me overwhelmed with various emotions, every episode in it's unique way with unique story. I really can not describe content, story, hidden message or characters with just words, I can only scream PLEASE WATCH THIS! Sometimes beginning of episodes may seem boring or dull, with slow developing story, but in the end every single episode gives you sucker punch that leaves you speechless.WATCH! WATCH! WATCH!\n",
            "Wow!! I've been a long time fan of Black Mirror, and while a lot of the previous episodes were hit-and-miss, this season was INCREDIBLE!! Not one episode failed to amaze, the writing and acting were immaculate and nothing was predictable. It was worth the wait, and my only regret is that I can't watch it again with fresh eyes. I cannot state strongly enough how great this show is, and I hope it continues for many, many more seasons. I cannot think of one episode of Season 6 I liked more than the others, insanely well-done, well-produced and probably the best thing on television right now. Maybe the best in the past decade.\n",
            "For choosing another way to keep Black Mirror alive and NETFLIX for streaming this. This was a great surprise I'm so excited and happy. I'm ignoring phone calls because of this lol. I'm texting everyone I know. Enjoy coffee with me or whatever you like with me. I'll be sure to rewatch the second episode because I'm texting this right now. I wish I could include emojis to express how I'm feeling right now. Just typing to meet the character requirements. That's all folks this is my second time doing a review. Thank you Thank you Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones and Netflix for how you continue to give us cinema.\n",

            "Episode 2(Smithereens) which is one of my favorites.The title of this review kinda gives it away.Will say it also has kind of a Truman Show vibe to it as well.It will kinda keep guessing until about the last 15 minutes of it. Then it comes together.All of the acting was done very well especially by\n",

            "The writing in this show is outstanding you can tell they are careful with details and if you re watch a episode you will see the little things the characters say to make sure the story is clear and point in a certain direction and because the writers are so good at turning your head to one part of the story, you realize that everything you knew was about the current plot has changed into a new meaning. i know this sounds weird but the stories are amazing. I binged watched this so much while my relationship was on the edge AND MY GIRLFRIEND LEFT ME. but its okay because i sorta feel like this is worth it lol this show needs to be more recognized.\n",

            "...Alfred Hitchcock, The X-files, or Fringe. I cannot add too much to all the other stellar reviews. This series popped up on Netflix and, after the first wild & crazy episode, I binged. Writing: incredible! The scripts are in the realm of J.J. Abrams quality with serious development evident and fine tuning obvious; crafted. Charlie Brooker is genius. Directing: the type of emotion and passion pulled from every single actor is just incredible; camera work seamless. Consider that each of the original six episodes were directed uniquely, the result across the series is a real achievement. Acting: take episode one's PM: Rory Kinnear playing the part of Michael Callow. He hit the mark so fantastically, and on top of that the supporting cast in that same episode all conveyed such incredible feeling. Empathy was basically thrown at you through their eyes - extras included. There were so many great performances, but one in particular by Lenora Crichlow as Victoria Skillane in episode six, deserves mention. As the primary character with complete focus throughout, her efforts were Emmy worthy. Summary: so surprisingly good I was truly blown away. A series like this does not come about often. I hope you enjoy it as much as so many others have.\n",
            "Brilliant scripts and screenplays. It packs all the jitters of a thriller and gloom of the dark side of technology.\n",
            "The series centers around it's title with both it's meanings. Black Mirror is another way of saying screen, TV screen, iPad, iPhone...etc. There is also the literal meaning, a mirror that reflects the darkness in our nature. In each episode the black screen is used as a way to reflect the worst humanity back at itself. Black mirror changes the story, setting and actors with every episode. Each is a self contained plot though it seems to happen within the same universe. This keeps things interesting and fresh with the motto show, show, show. I found the first episode to be re-pungent, Since this was the one used in the trailer before the show aired I had avoided this series for years. Fortunately the first two episodes were the most... I'm going to use the word controversial here since the one that comes to mind would be censored. After that the show finds it's moral footing. Because of this I don't think it's for everyone however the ideas and scenarios in the show are not too far fetched as regardless of the plot of the episode there is always the a central theme of focusing on the spectacle, of how things will be perceive. Rather than the person or their actions. In a world governed by Likes and star ratings, this makes sense and I would recommend it. Just maybe skip the very first episode if you didn't find the trailer appealing.\n",
            "4 Seasons. 19 different sessions of mental trauma. \n",
            "Black Mirror is 10 times terrifying than the best horror movie ever. It is disturbing to even think about the scenarios presented in each episode. The TV series themes the fatal attraction between human and technology. Black Mirror stories happen in a dystopian society which is soon going to be a reality for many of us. The show instills fear about the future we're moving into. As the makers expressed, this show is certainly not for the faint-hearted.\n",
            "A show that is shocking, emotional, disturbing, and entertaining at the same time. Some episodes may go a bit too far for some teenagers, so they may not be ready yet. Adults should be fine watching it if they are okay with shocking films.\n",
            "Started watching this show on Netflix over the weekend and I am hooked. Such a different show than anything on TV right now. Episodes make you think what the future could be like and how it may not always be such a great thing. Pros: Episodes feature different actors with different story lines, so no need to watch them in order (storyline does not continue from episode to episode) Cons: Need more episodes to watch! Good pickup Netflix!\n",
            "Black Mirror is clearly the best attempt to cyberpunk I've seen in years and if it wasn't for not having watched much television, I wouldn't believed I actualy missed out on it for so long. Maybe it's not actualy classified as cyberpunk. It's something different as if we needed a new genre to place this social and technological fiction that isn't so far off from what we already experience in the so-called \"first world\", or at least in most episodes. Each episode is an hour long and written by different people which makes the two season of the series, with three episodes each very diverse so far. there's also a christmas special and a third one coming out of netflix. It deals with the overabundance of conectivity and communication technologies in our lives, but isn't so far off from the present. Except having a 4-G or 5-G cellphone tracking your everymove seems acceptable while having it inside of your arm, or your eyes, or behind your ears seems different. It's those tiny differences that are making the stories of Black Mirror, but the real ones that are at stake in the criticism. And suddently you understand better why the techies wearing google glasses were getting a beat up when first introduced, or why there are signs baring entry to cyborgs and cameras to the social centers & infoshops. That's what science-fiction does best : changing little things to turn it into fiction, so that we're detached enough to finally understand our surroundings. I hope the netflix produced version is going to stay as critical but somehow doubt it.\n",
            "OK, I'm watching this series up to season 3 so far and I gotta say, why is there so much hate? I read so many hate comments saying how it tries to emulate Twilight Zone and it's not even as good as the reboot from 2002 So what if it's not as good as Twilight zone? It is still a good series, with episodes that are like mini movies with a good plot or a twist that makes them so enjoyable. Sure the first episode was a complete mess, but the rest of the episodes actually are entertaining to watch, with stories you can actually get a message from It's not the best series out there, but it's certainly far from being the worst just because \"it's not like Twilight Zone\" (which hardcore fans don't even liked the reboot) My advice, watch the series if you like thrillers or sci-fi movies, only that these last an hour or less\n",
            "Bringing back the classing Twilight Zone commentary under the guise of fiction, Black Mirror feels only SLIGHTLY exaggerated from where we're heading in the future. It's a horror classic with our reality laced in science fiction, with superb acting and writing that doesn't seem to quit even in their lesser-liked episodes. It's a win across the board. I recommend it to all of my friends and so should you!\n",
            "I rated this 10/10 because its the best show I have ever watched. I've never seen anything like it, seriously. When you explain to someone that the theme of this show is generally technology it sounds pretty boring, but trust me this is the most original and mind blowing show ever. Of course it has some good episodes, some bad ones (very few) and some INCREDIBLE ones. Personally my favourites are (in order): Shut up and dance, White christmas and Hang the dj. I love that they are all independent and different themed episodes. Of course, if you dont like weird things you will find this show quite disturbing because it is very explicit. For those who like weird, enjoy!!!\n",
            "Season 1-2\n",
            "Smartly written and well cast, the individual episodes keep circling back to such apprehensions, with darkly satiric overtones that distinguish it from most of what's currently on U.S. TV.\n",
            "Season 3\n",
            "Black Mirror continues to be as bracingly original and thought-provoking as ever before, a Twilight Zone-influenced gem for the technology age that Brooker only seems to get more creative at fleshing out.\n",
            "Season 4\n",
            "The \"grandson\" of Twilight Zone is loaded of surprises in the 4th season. The episodes that deserves all attention the ones that tributes Star Trek and Alfred Hitchcock presents. The final episode is an hyperbole.Stephen King described Black Mirror as \"terrifying, funny, intelligent. It's like the 'Twilight Zone,' only rated R.\" That's actually giving it short shrift. ... What makes the series special is how there is always one more twist that you didn't expect in the same way there is always some implication--usually for ill--in a new invention that we didn't think of. This new season will only add to the acclaim\n",
            "The best series I've seen this year! Really looking forward to the next episodes!\n",
            "It's a tough show to review because each episode is a stand alone movie. Some of these 'movies' have been some of the best tv I have seen. Some are just mediocre and increasingly more often in Season 5 & 6 where majority of episodes are mediocre and no stand out. I'm giving this a 9 out 10 just by looking at season 1-4.One reason I love the show is because it's a unique program often full of dark futuristic stories that really make you think about technology now and the future but also about broader human nature in stories unrelated to tech or the future. Taking chances like this will of course produce some misses but the mystery is what the story will be be about is addicting. In S1-4 it was often difficult to know where the story going -- often surprising you a few times while keeping you in suspense. S5 & S6 are less surprising and less important topics or just a bit too out there. I give S5 & S6 a 6.5/10. Worth a watch but not thrilling like first 4 seasons where I was hooked on the show.\n",
            "I started watching this show some years ago but stopped at season 1 which is quite bad. But as i am big scfi fan and not much of scfi shows are watchable nowdays i gave Black Mirror another try.And i have to say show is really worth it. Apart from season 1 which as i stated before is quite bad the rest of seasons are really great. Especially season 3 where every episode is a masterpiece, but seriously a masterpiece.\n",
            "Its great, it has something for everyone.My favs are white christmas and shut up and dance so far.We need more shows like this. As every story is different, so u don't get bored.\n",
            "Pretty good overall!! Some episodes are just mind blowing & amazing!! Love it!\n",
            "The series starts with a pretty disturbing first episode but it gets better with each episode. The special appearances by actors and early career roles for actors in the series is great as well. Watch it and you most likely won't regret it.\n",
            "I must say from the start to the end amazing!! I love how each episode is different and takes you into a new light. Very interesting movie with on point acting.\n",
            "All following episodes have been awesome. It's like a twisted combination of twilight zone and the Canterbury Tales by Chaucer on steroids. The show shines a light on our dependence on technology, our twisted social paradigms, and our hurtle toward a disturbing dystopian very-near future. Every story is a cautionary tale. My advice is to skip the first episode, I wish I had never seen it.\n",
            "Watching movie has always been my passion ever since I was a child. Among hundreds of movies that I have watched, the series Black Mirror impressed me the most.The series consist of multiple episodes illustrating the dark side of technological development. For me, although these movies are not too long, they have very profound meanings. In detail each episode shows us how dangerous technology could be either when they fall into the wrong hands or when we are too dependent on it and let it takes over our life. For example, there is an episode in which a boy was forced to do nasty and horrible things so that his secrets, which were stolen from the Internet, won't be exposed.To be honest, watching Black Mirror knocked me sideways since I have never imagined such scenarios could be possible. Despite knowing that they are only imaginary situation, there is nothing to ensure that they won't be happening in the future in real life. In addition, very few special effects were used, which was according to me, very surprising since they still managed to fully deliver their messages. Another factor contributed to Black Mirror's success is the performance of the actors. Most of the actors are not well-known but they did a great job demonstrating the feelings as well as the personality of different characters. Therefore, viewers could easily understand the gist of each episode.However, I feel that it is not suitable for certain people since it contains sexulal, nudity and violence content. On top of that, the series may be irritating for sensitive people to watch since in some episodes, the result or the message is quite scary to think about. Another drawback for Black Mirror is that it is not packed with action scenes which sometime might be a bit dull for me.In short words, Black Mirror gives us a big picture of our tomorrow world experiencing a rapid growth in the field of technology about how dreadful it could be. Although there are several minor cons, I find this series very though-provoking, all thanks to the amazing and creative minds of the director and screenwriter. There is no doubt that everyone should include Black Mirror in their must-watch list. With such meaningful content, I expect this series to gain even greater success in th future.\n",
            "This has been a truly adventurous journey of 6 seasons. Each of them unique giving us taste of horror, comedy, dark comedy, wild, politics, suspense and most importantly AI and Technological advancement.I have been watching Black Mirror from a long time and I can surely say that I have watched some amazing episodes leaving me stunned and apeechless most of the times.If you are bored to watch series which include too many episodes to finally come to an end then 'Black Mirror' is a perfect thing for you to enjoy. The only thing about this is that not everyone can watch this and No one will be able to enjoy all the episodes, especially the last 2 episodes of season 6, which fell totally irrelevant, weak or dull than all previous episodes or season. But leaving aside those episodes you will surely love this Black Mirror's idea of a single story for a single episode.\n",
            "I've been watching black mirror for about 3 years now. I've seen every episode twice and some episodes 3, 4 or even 5 times (Shut Up And Dance in particular). Every episode is intriguing right from the very start and keeps viewers hooked into the story until the end, with each episode having a unique and fitting soundtrack to really set the mood. The plot twists in some episodes are incredible and unpredictable, and even watching those episodes again and again and knowing how the episodes end, they're still just as entertaining. The scariness of it though, is the reality of it. Black mirror showcases how scary society could become in the 'near future', and the realism of how true it could all become is what's frightening. This realism adds to the thrill and horror of the show, and makes viewers especially intrigued into each episode.Some episodes however, ARE better than others. Hang The DJ, San Junipero, Black Museum, White Christmas, Shut Up And Dance, U. S. S Callister and Nosedive are among some of the best, and some of the not-so-entertaining ones, in my opinion, are Metalhead, The Entire History Of You and Rachel, and Jack And Ashley Too is just a plain over exaggerated teen drama, which is NOT black mirror. But, I'm still giving this show a 10, as the complete and utter brilliantness of each episode's storyline and the incredible episodes overall outweigh the not-so-good ones.Ive recommended black mirror to almost everyone I'm friends with, and it's always been a great entertainment/drama to watch at hangouts.I'm currently re-watching the show and the subtle excitement I'm getting from a possible season 6 persuaded me to write this review. Hoping it's better than season 5!\n",
            "Wow i was so amazed to be referred to this series.It had been long anything could catch my attention.I was kind off bored of routine content in many other series.Black mirror is just more than awesome.The mind behind this has to be appreciated.It not just entertainment but a food for thought kind off series.What creativity,what enactment superb drama !! I am actually short of words due to the uniqueness of this work. A view may be dystopian one at times but is really mind boggling.Tons pf appreciation and hatsoff to the creativity.\n",
            "I am soooooo glad I finally decided to watch this this weekend ! (Before even reading the reviews ) its sun april 24th 2022 and ive been at home since Friday binge watching I'm on season3 ep2? I think BLACK MUSEUM! EACH EPISODE FROM 1 TO NOE IS BINGE WORTHY !!! IF YOU LOVE SUSPENSE MYSTERY THRILLER THIS IS IT!!! I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS OTHER THEN THE TWILIGHT ZONE! THIS IS A MIND BLOWING MASTERPIECE I APPLAUD THE WRITERS AND PRODUCERS FOR BRINGING SOMETHING SO GREAT TO KEEP OUR MINDS OFF REALITY (KIND OF) BC THERES SOMETHING'S THAT JUST REMINDS YOU OF IT BUT IN A GREAT WAY!!!!! YOU LITERALLY DONT KNOW HOW EACH EP IS GONNA END! ITS THAT SHOCKING!!!! I THINK B. M. IS RANKED TOO LOW 8.8???? UUUHHH GOOOGLE UP THE ANTY AND GIVE B. M. ITS JUST DUE!!!! 10!!!!!!!!!! OUT OF 10 !!!!!! BEST THING ON TELEVISION TO DATE!!!!!!\n",
            "Downloaded all episodes on my phone and watched them with my GF at night while away in Marrakech, I think.\n",
            "Episodes from first seasons then gave us thrills and nightmares just as bad as being lost in the suburbs of the infamous marocan city when we had to pay to escape whole but enough about our trips.\n",
            "It's trippy and I kept adoring the series all the way trough the last season.\n",
            "It's worth getting a couple of months or even at least a free one just to watch this great series.\n",
            "Good job Netflix!\n",
            "I hope more episodes are in the making.\n",
            "This series is a pure gold. It is so fascinating and very well made, that i admire those who write the stories. Such a creative team! Not all the episodes are perfect, (while, most of them are..) but this concept is a perfection. Sci-Fi series that is not about promoting Sci-Fi, but how we humans could get affected by new technologies. It makes you think, and it makes you think deep.\n",
            "In the last couple of days, everybody around me were talking about this series thus I decided to start watching it. When I watched the first episode, I was impressed enough. First of all the way they summarize the topic is unique unprecedentedly. In each episodes, it has a different team different actors and actresses also different stories but all episodes has a common point which is criticisms of modern society and its challenges. We all can see modern technology became our new friend that is ruining our life in every second of every day.This is more than a TV series, this is giving us a way to think with a critical approach. Thanks for giving me a different point of view.\n",
            "Black Mirror it's an English series absolutely actual, it's mostly a drama/sci-fi series and it's centered on the current or future problems of the western society. It's already on the third season but you have to consider that every episode it's a movie completely different between each other and without a common script. But every single episode it's able to bring you in that word and environment, every single episode is well written and well directed and the cast works great. It's one of the best series of the last years due this uniqueness. Since is treating and telling story and problems about the actual or near future society and the dark side of technology you have to consider that every single episode is a reflection and meditation starting point that most of the time can let the viewer with a sad sensation or let with a bitter taste. Absolutely a must to watch\n",
            "Black Mirror is the most hard-hitting hypothetical on the psychological horror of unhampered technological advance I've ever seen... it reminds us that the potential side effects or opportunities for abuse are as limitless as human nature, and easily as devastating as biological tampering. Our current reckless obsession with pushing forward and rolling out new gadgets and systems without ANY thought for the potential consequences, combined with our smug self-assurance that technology is always beneficial to humanity is truly what makes this terrifying stuff. Guns in the hands of children. A brilliantly conceived and written show. I could not fault the acting, editing, camera-work, set pieces, soundtrack, scripting or effects. I honestly haven't been blown away by such a genius social commentary since... well forever. Do yourself a favour and watch them all. You may find yourself looking at your mobile phone with a strange sense of revulsion afterwards. Not to mention the internet.\n",
            "Better than these IMDB rated greats: Game of Thrones (they remove too many of your favorite characters and there are too many episodes where nothing of significance or entertainment happens but for 10 out of 60 of the minutes of the given episode), all the David Attenborough nature/science documentaries\n",
            "(Which are spectacular to say the least), Fargo, the Office, The Dark Knight (actually overrated. Batman the animated series and batman Begins far superior) and many more.I put black mirror on top 25.\n",
            "This is the most brilliant TV Show (Drama) ever! I want more and more and more episodes, please. I'm done watching all 19 episodes and I must say it was amazingly done in all aspects of the film. The 19 episodes were all great. The actors, the director, the writer, the setting, the involvement of technology & innovation, and the moral lessons we learned. I think if you're a person who is into technology and appreciates how it works, you will surely relate to each episode. The common ground is the technology and innovation. How it could affect our living today and in the future. All stories have a basis or common logic and who knows it could really happen to you in the future. You have to be open-minded and understand the logic of technology in order to understand and relate yourself to each story. I think ALL 19 episodes were my favorite ones. By the way, I work as a freelance web developer and really into online games and technology and latest innovation, so I really like and appreciate this kind of show. Very refreshing and new. Also, the casts were great. I like the idea of mixing famous actors and newbies. It's always nice to see new faces on the screen. Kudos Black Mirror! I want more episodes for the next season please! :)\n",
            "Black Mirror is one of those programmes that never, no matter what, disappoints. After emotionally tearing you apart, psychologically intoxicating you, and even after intellectually stimulating to the point of lunacy, you will still be looking forward to watch an other episode. However, you will only be marvelled that each episode contains different characters, setting and plot. This certainly happened to me and I couldn't stop thinking about how a future that seems so distant in the episodes, could actually be the state of humanity in 10 minutes. Maybe this is the reason why Black Mirror is so good. It leaves you to think what happens after the episode has finished and your screen has turned black. Turned into a black mirror itself.\n",
            "Although this show can definitely be corny/edgy, I think every episode of this show (minus the bear episode) catches my attention and makes me want to keep watching! I think they are enjoyable to watch and they have very nice cinematography as well as well performing actors. With the exception of (the masterpiece that is) San Junipero, they are all genuinely creepy to some degree too. My favorite episodes would be Fifteen Million Merits, White Bear, San Junipero and Playtest. The Banksy-esque technology themes can seem a little tiresome but not enough so that it affects my interest in the show! I'll Keep watching until they stop making them.\n",
            "On the wall. What the best TV series of them all?Well, this is certainly one of them. Black Mirror trapped me, looking into it's gaze and I loved what I saw staring back at me. Each story is different, but all episodes have an undercurrent of technological variations. It highlights what society will become (and in some cases already is), from being completely obsessed with our phones and social media (society is well past this point), to the afterlife and how we might best use technology for the power of good...and love. There were perhaps 2 weak episodes for me personally, one being 'Men Against Fire' (yawn) and the second being 'White Bear'. They for me were just a bit boring and done to death. All the other episodes border from sublime - to breathtakingly beautiful. All of the episodes are wonderfully acted though. Do not miss out on this. Disturbing yes- but it reflects a world we actually inhabit now - damned until the end of this civilisation, shackled to our phones and selfies. Some may look at themselves differently after this- I certainly did. Judging by this body of work, the writer Charlie Brooker is, quite frankly a Genius.\n",
            "Black Mirror is a British TV show that shows the darkest aspects of life and technology. Each episode is a different story, but they all have one thing in common: make you think about how technology/life/human beings can be terrifying. It's kind off a sci- fi/drama/thriller show that really messes with you and I believe it changes you. You'll not forget it soon.The first episode was so disturbing, I can't even describe how shocked I was during the whole thing. The rest are also disturbing but not as much as the first one. I think it was a statement: \"this is not going to be a easy TV show to watch but we show the truth about cruelty, about how technology can impact our lives and about us, human beings\". I watched all the episodes and I can say they are disturbing (in different levels) but they're all very impressive, well executed and we can see how much effort and thought all the directors/writers/actors put in each episode.If you watch the first one and just want to quit, give it another chance and watch the third (which I think is one of the best episodes of a TV show I have ever watched). Give it a chance and watch the first season, it's only three episodes and, believe me, it's worth it.\n",
            "So I've seen a lot of the episodes. The strength of the series is definitely the ability to take aspects of modern life and spin them to their logical extremes to make a point. So, for example, you take a world that shares and rates every aspect of our lives on social networks and imagine a world where those networks aren't just harmless wastes of time but can actually impact your ability to get a job or find a place to live. Or you look at our modern democratic system that constantly monitors public opinion to make policy and imagine a situation where a politician must do truly disgusting things to appease the masses, even at the expense of their dignity and family.There's nothing wrong with these ideas; science fiction has a long and storied history of critiquing society to point out potential issues and moral hazards. The problem I do have is the way the stories wind down and the conclusions they draw. Almost without exception the conclusions are bleak. Characters never make the right choices or even if they do they are inevitably crushed by the systems they rebel against.If you think of these stories as little horror movies, it's the point at the end of the film where the survivors either get to walk away having experienced something horrible but having survived and learned a little bit about themselves along the way, or they all get slaughtered and the last scene is the final survivor being pulled back down into the darkness by the monster and the camera panning twenty feet over to the safety they almost reached.Both types of endings have their place. But when you choose to use only one of them the negativity starts to get a bit stifling. There has to be hope sometimes or it just feels depressing and pessimistic. I suppose this may just be a personal thing, others may not mind the continuously bleak outlook, but for me it gets really hard to watch more than one or two of these in a month.The acting is usually pretty decent, as are the production values. The writing is also usually quite decent, although they often stretch logic to the breaking point to get the ending they envision. I guess this would be a mini spoiler warning, but there is one episode where a sophisticated device malfunctions to lethal effect because of interference from a common, everyday piece of personal electronics, the equivalent of a commercial airliner hurtling into the ground because you didn't turn your cell phone off. To call that absurd doesn't really even begin to cover it; it could never happen.So in the end, my feelings about the show are rather mixed. To some degree I really like the creativity of the concepts and the decent execution, but on the other hand I find myself feeling rather depressed by the constant negativity and a little irritated that I can usually guess how the story will end half way thru because it is always the most bleak ending that they run with.\n",
            "I've not yet watched all available episodes of Black Mirror, but my impression so far is that this is completely unlike any other series (anthology or otherwise) I've seen. The stories are diverse and seem to come out of left field, which is brilliant in its own right. They do share a common theme, however - examining the darker side of technology and how it's come to dominate our lives for better or worse.Can't really say much more without spoiling it but one doesn't need to be a science fiction/fantasy fan to truly appreciate this show. It's got a powerful message and will, in my opinion, inspire viewers to contemplate some of the larger questions facing the human race. The drama and acting are uncommonly good to excellent; the pacing taut and intense. It's an enjoyable experience as much as it can be an uncomfortable one, but the discomfort is a good thing; after all, how many t.v. shows truly make us use our brains these days?\n",
            "In a summary we can say that the proposal of this season had everything to go right, great storyline, ideas and technique, but lacked life, identification, and without it sounds like something shallow.\n",
            "In a sentence about this season: It's like reading a book and not creating that world inside your head.\n",
            "There is no emotion, feelings, identification, it's just cool.\n",
            "This is one of the most amazing series I seen recently.It clearly shows the dark side of the technology - sometimes it looks similar to 1984 and The Brave New World. it has a dark (noire) style and it is not an optimistic view of our near future, but it really catch the moment. This is not a story what you can watch easily, you need to prepare your mind to be opened to the future technologies and the dark side of the humanity. You experience and learn how man can give u sovereignty and independence. It is a vision of total control and mass surveillance never seen before. There is an episode for a kind of digitized heaven and eternal life, but the story about humans , their minds and how they can deal the options they have. So fasten your seat belt and start your journey...\n",
            "If you want to mess with your mind, Black Mirror is the show to watch. While taking pieces of current society, it creates a world that is believable. I wouldn't say it's necessarily horror or anything along those lines, but it gives you a chill throughout your body. I also love how each episode is unique of its story, so it doesn't necessarily drag on like other shows.\n",
            "The acting is great mostly, sometimes it isn't the best - but the strong actors pull through. The scenery, plot, costuming, etc. is outstanding. It's a diverse cast, and you can understand how the talent got to be there.\n",
            "I love Black Mirror. Thanks for messing with my mind, and creating the idea that the world we live in, may be a simulation <3\n",
            "Each episode is just one hour but it feels like you have seen a movie. High production quality. Its not only about technology but about human emotions. Best blend of technology and human emotions. This is the only TV series I finished all the episodes. I could not wait to watch the next one. Do not miss it.\n",
            "It's not often I say this but this really is must see television.\n",
            "If you can't get in to it then I don't know how to help you.\n",
            "Don't just watch one episode. They are all so different that you really have to watch 3 or 4 before making up your mind.\n",
            "Since you all know each episode is a different story, and its difficult to score the entire series. Few of the stories will blow your mind. Most of them are good. The third episode of Season 5 is very very bad and melodramatic.\n",
            "The First three seasons were very very good and would get a strong 9/10. Drops a bit at fourth season which to be honest is a 7.5/10.\n",
            "Overall this is a series that you must watch. Another good thing about it is that you can just pick any episode and start watching.\n",
            "If you want to feel even more anxious about life, the future and especially technology, by all means, watch this.I personally found it beyond depressing, and absurd.\n",
            "This series caught my thought and displayed it on international media.\n",
            "Definitely worth seeing! Definitely brilliant..definitely touching...the show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature..The stories are mostly set in a world that is badly influenced by modern technology. What makes \"Black mirror\" special ?!..'Details' , great filming,acting,directing ...asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. Or maybe already have taken us. Definitely worth seeing 👌\n",
            "Cleverly put together by making good use of the horror that modern technology and social media can be. Just like the old Twilight Zone series of the 80s, this series give the same creepiness and mystery.\n",
            "I love rewatching episodes with friends that haven't seen any, seeing their reactions and talking about it afterwards to hear pov is interesting. Yes the Miley episode and season 5 was disappointing but the other season were absolutely brilliant. Especially loved Bandersnatch. Well done!\n",
            "First of all, if you browsing for a show to watch, look no more and go with Black Mirror ( im surprised that you havent allready). But i found it myself by accident, looking for a good show to chill. And man, was i hooked from the 1st 5 mins.\n",
            "Its really good show, each episode will surprise with the meh moment again and again. Every time i found myself wondering about the episode i watched, days after.\n",
            "This series is very well written and extremely unique in its ideas. It explores the dark side of humanity and technology through each episode which features a stand alone story. If you were a fan of the Twilight Zone then this might float your boat, but it may be all too real for some people to handle!\n",
            "I Actually Dont Watch Sci-Fi But Black Mirror Is Something Different.\n",
            "You'll never get the same thing twice and will be gripped to the edge of your seat. You won't know how to feel until the credits roll and I love every roller coaster of emotion.\n",
            "It's intriguing. Except for the 5th season just skip that.\n",
            "This show was recommended to me by my NYU graduate brother for Film. He produces commercial film. Every time he recommends some show or movie or mentions it, I check it out and this one was just so unexpected. This is meant for high iq people or people with a higher illuminated intellect. If not you will not understand it or understand why it has such high ratings. If you don't know if you have the intellect to watch the show, watch the first episode & then continue to the 2nd. You will see 2 drastic changes in between the two. If you understand after episode 2-3 what is going on, then you're stuck on this and now have been enlightened. Good luck on the binge then waiting a year for 3 episodes like the rest of us. - OG IMDb User reviewer.\n",
            "Hard Hitting! This is the perfect example of the future of humanity. Every episode is superb. I want to salute the writers of this series. My favorite season is season 3 (Nosedive, hated by nation, and men against fire).\n",
            "You know when you get a great steak? So you go back to the restaurant and order it again. Well it ain't easy getting it right every-time..Black mirror started out as a low budget channel 4 UK gig and picked up a fanbase so the USA took it forward. To their credit the bigger budgets delivered greater productions. The whole things a great watch. Series 5. Well its stumbling a little. First one out wasnt great the next was good and the third with miley cyrus got mixed reviews. I liked that one the most. Overall if your a scifi fantasy type of lover your at the right gig. 9/10\n",

            "I love science fiction genre and the show has completely lived upto my expectations .Every episode is different and provides a new innovative idea .Science fiction is generally difficult to portray but Black Mirror does it amazingly well. It can also be great for people who are on a tight schedule and get very less time to enjoy ,they could watch a single episode and be at work again unlike other shows in which we keep thinking what will happen next 😂 even when we are at work .A must watch show for people who want something new!\n",
            "I loved Black Mirror from the very first episode when I saw it on Channel 4 years ago. The first three seasons were everything I wanted in an edgy sci-fi show, it was satirical and insightful. It had something to say about society and the human condition.Then it jumped to Netflix and season four was largely OK. Not everything worked but some of the episodes were classic Black Mirror. Then came Bandersnatch which was good but more of a gimmick than anything else.Then came season 5. My God, how the mighty have fallen. I got a sense that these episodes were knocked out quickly as the dialogue was awful, the themes had all been touched on before and there were only three episodes. Out of the three only Smithereens was any good but, in comparison to earlier episodes, it was only a shadow of what came before.Black Mirror used to have bite but Series 5 just sucks, which is all you can do when you've lost your teeth.\n",
            "Season 3 is my favorite. All the episodes in session 3 was great. But in all other seasons , few episodes we're good , few we're bad. It's worth giving a try, if you are a technology, innovation lover. Few episodes we're absolutely brilliant.\n",
            "Unreal! A lot for think about after each episode.\n",
            "Best series ever.\n",
            "My favorite SciFi shows are the original Twilight Zone, X-Files, Twin Peaks, Stranger Things, Maniac, Manifest, and Fringe. What a great show this is. It's stunning! The writing puts most other shows to shame. I don't care if it's cliché, but San Junipero was my favorite episode. This one stood out to me the most. Some of the other episodes were more heart pumping and filled with action, but I really enjoyed the story on this one. Acting is also stellar across all episodes. Short review, but if you like the other shows I've listed, you'll really enjoy this one.\n",
            "This show..THIS SHOW, what kept me away for so long from watching this show. Thank you Charlie Brooker for the best show of all time.Black Mirror is a television series that originally aired on E4 for it's first two series until it was bought by Netflix, and has received a much more bigger audience since its removal. If I had to say, I do believe the show was a tiny bit better then when it was on E4, but I mean a TINY bit better, I am not saying the show got worse, but you can tell it got way more involved with the US, but still kept to it's original British roots. The series takes place in either the same universe or 19 different universes, which would make more sense as the show is very hard to piece together as a related universe show, and follows different futures where technology slowly begins to outsmarts man, in good ways and bad ways (by good ways I mean San Junipero and that's it). I am literally in love with the show, as it practically shows us how one day, technology is gonna roar over humankind and probably destory us, if it's physically or mentally. Some of the stories have already frickin happened (Nosedive, Be Right Back, National Anthem). The show has no bad episodes, although some do feel very poorer to others, but still send powerful messages. If there was a episode to send a silly message, it would have had to been Metalhead (even though I still love the episode and remain in my top 10 favourites) or Playtest or Men Against Fire, which were my two least favorite episodes out of the entire show. My favourite episodes have to be Fifteen Million Merits, Nosedive and San Junipero, darkest episodes would have to be Shut Up And Dance, Crocodile and White Bear, while least favourites would have to be Men Against Fire and Playtest.Well, Black Mirror is officially my new favorite show now, sorry American Horror Story!\n",
            "Each and every episode is a masterpiece, written to perfection. Every viewer will feel something different from what episode they've just watched. I know that after most episodes I feel a little frightened for my children as I am fully aware of what the future is bringing.\n",
            "I always like new idea ,and this series all about new ideas and perfectly surprised me by any episodes ,i f suggest you to watch it , you wont regret it\n",
            "OK- I wouldn't rate alle the parts with 9 stars, but most of them. Scary science fiction that is a good critique of the dark side of modern scientific advances that are changing our society or about to change it.\n",
            "I don't know who had the original idea for this, but I want some of what he/she had....\n",
            "What a concept.. Excellent story-lines, great acting, great direction, great production.. !!\n",
            "If you haven't watched it yet.. Just start.. Like, NOW!PS: The first episode is not indicative at all for what follows on the rest of the seasons, so don't dismiss it before you have another go. Not that it's bad, but as I said. Not indicative.\n",
            "The biggest problems with black mirror are similar to a show like The Twilight Zone. Making a show where each episode is different from the next can result in a mixed bag of quality.\n",
            "Seriously though black mirror is great because when it gets its satire right, it is truly unforgettable. I can't stop thinking about the Christmas special because of its fantastic ending. There are duds in this shows run obviously, but they aren't awful episodes. It's a strong show and there is not much more I can say\n",
            "Also watch bandersnatch\n",
            "The fusion of fiction and imagination with perfect presentation creates magic, if you add darkness to it, it breaks the boundaries of all imaginations. That's what Black Mirror does. The idea and its execution is flawless. Bravo team Black Mirror! When i think creativity is fading, you shake me to the core with every new episode, and i find myself swimming, drowning in the deepest sea of thoughts and awe!!!\n",
            "God this series is so good yall who havent watched u rly shld go check it out. after watching each episode, your brain gon full of stuff going on in ur head. its just so awesome. i-\n",
            "The first two seasons of Black Mirror are probably my favorite content ever to be produced for TV. It's been fuel for a couple existential crisis's and it wears proudly it's heart on it's sleeve. No other TV show has put me in such a trance like state. Every single single scenario feels absolutely plausible, and when it doesn't, it's only because of this coating of sarcasm that makes itself obvious to the spectator. The casting is perfect.\n",
            "What I love the most is the fact that every single episode becomes absolutely captivating after maybe 20 minutes, and never stops from there. I don't see this as a science fiction show. To me it feels like a social experiment, where they basically created a sandbox in order to play with the flaws of humans, showing that no matter how much technology evolves, we're still the same.If only I could say that about the entire series.After White Christmas, the stories lost their meaning. You can still enjoy the very forward thinking implementation of how humans would react to new tech, but it definitely feels more plastic. It's politics are mostly gone, and only present in very cliche narratives. This doesn't apply to everything though, Hang the DJ and San Junipero are both beautiful examples of how much they can play with your emotions in a productive way.Give this show a try. Even if you disagree with it's premise, it's still nutrient-rich fruit for thought.\n",
            "A friend recommended this show a while ago and to pass the time in between new Twin Peaks episodes we decided to binge this series. The first season kept us hooked really well. Original writing, super sharp editing, decent acting and class. The next few episodes in season 2 were still good and exciting. A lot of nice atmosphere, which I love.But when season 3 started everything seemed different. It went from clever to mediocre acting and shallow writing. And these predictable plots are worked out in an action-for-the-sake-of-action package. So then we lost interest. The page turner effect vanished somehow, it's almost like the later episodes are student films, which is a shame really, I'd prefer it if shows just stopped when the inspiration is gone. Nevertheless, the first two seasons are definitely worth a watch.\n",
            "Black mirror was superb , each episodes are wonderful , and it keeps curiosity till the end , and every episodes are better than another episodes , whole seasons like just WOW !!!\n",
            "Black mirror-\n",
            "Black mirror, each episode tells a different story, thoughtfully made by different directors. Black mirror is available on Netflix with every episode showing different stories. Not a single episode is related to one another. This show particularly talks about the advancement in technology we will have in the coming years and how it will affect each individual in different ways.What makes this show which is available on Netflix so different from other shows is the way it portrays the stories with such details. All the actors did a great job and each story seems very new, exciting and engaging.After watching the whole series one can get an idea that this show's beauty lies in its remarkable ability to speculate on the potential future of our technologically driven world. For example, one of its episodes shows the use of artificial bees by govt. To spy on people and how it is even good for the environment. By the end of this episode, the system gets hacked, people are targeted and killed by the bees etc. Viewers should be warned that the series does not shy away from exploring disturbing themes such as murder, crime, and suicide. Very few of the episodes show happy ending and each story seems to be open ended.The compelling narrative of each episode is further elevated by powerful performances from the cast, adding depth to their characters and stories. Every element of the show - from the direction to the performances, and even the music - seamlessly comes together to create a truly unforgettable viewing experienceThis Netflix series keeps viewers wanting to watch more from start to finish. And by looking at the current developments in the technology, it really makes you believe in the gadgets used in the show. Each episode is phenomenal in its own way. The direction, performance, music everything is just amazing. All these things give this show a special touch which one cannot ignore. The episodes show us both the amazing and dangerous sides of playing with technology.While the show often ends on a somber note, it never fails to captivate the audience. It's disturbing yet thought-provoking themes make us reflect on the trajectory of our current technological advancements. In the end, \"Black Mirror\" is not just a TV show. It's a thrilling and sometimes scary look at our world, showing us where we are now and where we might be going. This Netflix series is truly a one-of-a-kind experience that keeps viewers hooked from beginning to end.\n",
            "I love the first couple seasons. They do a great job of being entertaining and thought provoking. I like that the episodes are self contained so you don't need to watch them in order.\n",
            "It is one of the best mind opening show which hits in a very serious yet lesser known issue to humankind. Technology is a boon for us but it can be a bane it not kept in check.\n",
            "A must watch!!\n",
            "I just started this series I know I'm 8 years late, but tbh it is one of the best series I've ever watched so far! I don't think there is gonna be anything like this. The acting is so great, and what I like most is that you CAN'T guess the ending of an episode, they just surprise you,like the 2nd episode from season 3 \"PLAYTEST\". I'm already Googling if there is a 5th season and I'm still on the 3rd one LOL\n",
            "....this enough. Each episode is better, and more surprising, than the one before. Does it tend to caution regards technology? Yes...and it SHOULD...we don't want Idiocracy to become prophecy.\n",
            "This series is really futuristic and Best Sci-fi Series I've ever watched.\n",
            "Not all the episodes of Black Mirror are great but there is a decent variety of them... Ironically Blue Bear associates with Trump and David Cameron does like bacon... The show touched a lot of interesting subjects, but some of the best ideas were taken from other shows not widely known to major public and popular culture... The whole concept of consciousness transfers, comes from BSG/ Caprica, especially from Caprica, a show not many now and not many heard about... So if you like the whole idea of storing consciousness on other devices or inside robots, transferring them to other virtual worlds and so on and so on, check out Caprica... Nevertheless \"USS Callister was my favourite episode and as much as I love it it's a dark Star Trek which should have had his own spin off...\n",
            "Brilliant insights of where technology can take us. Throws out the deep agony human instinct and technology coupled take us. For sure not the average series you see.\n",
            "There is not enough episodes in a season.each episode is different from the last and revolves around technology.\n",
            "i do like the fact that all the characters are different too.\n",
            "its tough to review a series with a different plot for each episode,\n",
            "but I really enjoyed it.\n",
            "you will have episodes that you loved and some that are meh.\n",
            "recommend watching the trailer just remember each one is different than the last.\n",
            "enjoy ... RMD\n",
            "This show is one hell of a ride. I definitely enjoyed some episodes more than others but I cannot say that I disliked any of them. All of them are unique and disturbing in their own way and I was glued to the screen throughout the entire series.\n",
            "This has got to be the best anthology type show I have ever seen. I am astonished by how often an episode leaves me breathless. This show is at the apex of the current batch of brilliant TV shows. It is a commentary on contemporary society, technology, love, loss, remembrance, apathy, sympathy, pathos, and metaphysics. It is sometimes satirical, sometimes sad, and sometimes biting and sardonic. It is witty, beautifully written, directed and cast. Wish it could go on forever.\n",
            "Really makes you think about the damage companies like google and Facebook can do to society. Many of the episodes seem to be explicit commentaries on how dangerous in can be to trust companies that exist only to collect and exploit their users data.\n",
            "This show is seriously incredible! Every episode is so intriguing and great in it's own unique way and it really gets you thinking. If you're considering watching this absolutely do it! I watched it the first time thinking \"oh idk if i'll like this it kinda seems weird\" and now it's my favourite show and i've watched it several times! There's at least one episode for everyone but i was personally captivated by every single episode. This is my go to show to recommend to anyone and everyone.\n",
            "I have watched all the episodes and I love most of them, there are some that dont really resonate with me. However, all the episodes stand alone and could honestly be reviewed separately. Dont judge this show based on the first episode.\n",
            "In every episode you are going to see that the story will be connected to technology . Some may say that all the episodes are not connected but I would say yes because you will spot some elements from previous if you are an observer . This is one of the best series on Netflix I have watched which makes me long for more . Credit to the makers on how they have used the technology so well.\n",
            "Season 5 may be terrible, but Black Mirror is a very impressive, original show with lots of interesting ideas.\n",
            "This show was set beyond our time, incredibly interesting with ideas on our mind! To see our ideas played out was so interesting to watch.\n",
            "Definitely that Black Mirror is a great Series, I simply advice all people to see this great show. In the beginning, the three first episode can be a little strangers and not so good like you are waiting for, but if you still seeing the rest of seasons, you will stay addicted that you wanna see more and more, because it's something really interesting. Just only more one thing, the most of episodes don't have nothing connected with previous episodes, but each of them are a great show that worth so much see. 10/10\n",
            "This is great show, but without season 5.Season 5 is comedy.\n",
            "This series is a true eye opener for today 's modern times. It offers a very plausible simulation of a not-so-distant future and it's scary. Really scary. Makes you question your lifestyle and your choices. It tackles all addictive aspects of modern society, such as video games, social media, consumerism, etc. Definetely worth watching, if you don't live in a box.\n",
            "I was very exciting about this show, but after the last episode I become disappointed. Don't get me wrong. The first episode of Black Mirror was a pleasure, while the second was absolute disappointment.The pilot hooked me so strong that I recorded it, while the second episode throw me away after 20 minutes of watching. I hoped that it will continue that excitement and great story from pilot, but it failed.I will not spoil here about the plot, but the first episode is all that is worth to see Black Mirror. I just hope that the third episode will bring back that good feeling as it was at the start.I could not find much of information about the show, nor there are many of reviews there, nor ratings here on IMDb, but if I could conclude something about this series from first episode, it is the great critique on today's society, especially to the Government apparatus. I like the idea how they represent protest to the leading structure.\n",
            "This is one of those shows that from the description you just aren't sure if it will be for you. It's worth it. This show creates different levels of attachments to the characters in the short period of time you have with them. Production value means nothing if the story doesn't grab you and pull you in, but do not underestimate the power of having these two elements in an excellent mini-series. The creativity that went into each unique story is enthralling! It's absolutely worth taking the journey that is \"Black Mirror\".Characters - 9/10 Creativity - 10/10 Cinematography - 8/10 Editing - 8/10\n",
            "'Black Mirror' has been great since day one. Yes, there are some less then perfect episodes but as a whole series it's pretty neat all around.Dark with some good stories that are not just science fiction but also a look at society as a whole thing. Most episodes leave you thinking of certain things and issues long after the credits roll. That's how it should be.This new season is pretty good with two excellent episodes. My only real complaint is that I wish the seasons were longer. But quality over quantity as they say.This is a great series for sci-fi fans and non sci-fi fans alike. Something for everyone.\n",
            "I don't easily give 10's, but a 9 just didn't feel right for this show. This is VERY well written (acted, produced, directed) and a breath of fresh air between the many American series. Don't get me wrong, things like Breaking Bad are great, but very different. Where every once in a while a BB-episode will end with a truly shocking event, every single one of these Black Mirror-episodes feels like one big shock. (Then again, they only make 3 episodes per season!) The material is such an accurate reflection of the time we live in and is so condensed that the stories are hard to shake off for quite some days after viewing. Again, very well written. Notice, for instance, how amazingly natural the dramatic principle of foreshadowing is applied.\n",
            "This series is not meant to be binged, it's designed to make you think. I'll catch my self thinking about the outcome of various episodes and their meaning in today's society. Definitely a must watch, but be sure to let each story settle in and digest. My favorite episodes are \"The National Anthem\", \"Be Right Back\", \"Playtest\", \"Metalhead\" and \"Smithereens\". I did enjoy the latest season, but felt it lacked some of the pop previous seasons had.\"Loch Henry\" had to my pick of the season, as it explored how well do you know your family and community. There were also sudden undertones about how tragedy can be exploited for one's own personal gain.\n",
            "I am impressed by this excellent series. Each and every episode is like a stand alone movie - except that it has a by far over average strong and deep story and plot. The production is excellent as well. I have seen all 3 seasons and there are no weak episodes. The Quality is very high. It's probably the best series/movie(s) I have seen for many years - or ever. I am grateful for artists and producers that create material of such quality. It awakens my own creativity as well.However, I would like to add a warning label: The stories are, to say the least, not inspirational uplifting - reminding you the title \"black mirrors\". This is not the best pick on bad and depressing days, or just before you go to bed. Horror movies like Blair Witch is a good-night story by comparison. Black mirrors challenges our deepest existential fears and unachievable desires in life.\n",
            "Even though some episodes are better than others, all of them are a masterpiece! A very unique show which I definitely recommend for older teenagers and adults. Almost every episode has some sort of twist or an ending that absolutely blows you away! I've heard of Black Mirror several times in the past but never attempted to watch it because the anthropology component didn't interest me and I had never watched an anthropology before. But now that I've watched it I would do anything to watch this magnificent show for the first time. So to anybody reading this, I beg you to give Black Mirror a chance.\n",
            "It's stark, chilling, funny, acerbic, gut wrenching, thought provoking and complex. There are some duds, (like the waldo moment and the miley Cyrus episode) but the majority are superb. The entire history of you and fifteen million credits in particular stayed with me for days, as well as white Christmas. I genuinely wanted to quit my phone, sell my stuff and move off grid after watching a few of them, but like everyone else im hopelessly addicted. Which is the point brookers trying to make.The stories are wonderfully intricate and multi faceted and offer a stark glimpse into our futures. Be right back was devastating to watch, as my husband died 15 years ago, and goodness..that one hurt to watch. But its not all sad and gloomy, hang the dj and uss callister are more uplifting. I watched them from season 5 to 1 (just because) and it was interesting to see the budget diminish, along with some pretty sweet cgi, but even the first season worked well without it. I really hope it doesn't lose it's originality and penchant to..well, mirror us, for the sake of big named stars becoming involved.\n",
            "Just started watching this in 2015 and i'm completely blown away, every single episode manages to really disturb me and touch me on an emotional level. The series, in which we follow a new set of characters in a new story each episode we see the flaws of our society, how technology, art, politics and so on can utterly obliterate our sense of reality. The different themes of each episode is very welcoming and the stories fit perfectly in the 40min time frame. I can without doubt say that this is the most heartfelt and sad series i have ever watched and after days i'm still thinking about each and every episode!Must see 10/10\n",
            "After some episodes, which was just stupid, I planned to rate it with 1 star. But when I increase engagement , I found that it was not so bad what I thought in previous. So rated it with an average. Liked it. All the best to the director.\n",
            "Forget what people say and watch it the first episode is the worst but still acceptable but the second and the third is incredible\n",
            "Never had a television show keep me invested as much as Black Mirror has. Truly captivating and terrifying warning of our soon-to-be future. I love how Charlie Brooker uses a positive and negative light on the topic of tech in the show. The episode \"San Junipero\" shows how amazing and beautiful technology can be. Episodes like \"Playtest\" and \"Metalhead\", however, show how dangerous and terrifying technology can be. Season six is even better!! Don't trust season 6's bad reviews. Seeing Brooker take a entire different route in the horror genre was so refreshing to see, and it was done perfectly! My favorites were \"Loch Henry\" and \"Beyond the Sea\" They were true horror situations.Please, take some time out of your day and watch this amazing masterpiece of twists, turns, and horror!\n",
            "This compelling series make you think. It's definitely not one of those bubblegum flavored shows that one just spits out and forget about the next day. Who would LOVE this:People who like reading slightly macabre short story anthologies People who like sci-fi People who want to delve into the dark side/implications of technology People who love watching episodes that stay with you long after you've watched themWhat to LOVE:Amazing premise for each episode (fresh, original, etc.) Great actingGorgeous visuals Brilliant directionI highly recommend this!\n",
            "The mind-boggling British science fiction \"The Black Mirror\" haunts the use of modern day technology through sharp and suspenseful episodes that present possible societal consequences.\n",
            "Each episode contains a whole new story line and cast as it showcases a main character being challenged by \"new age\" technology, essentially going through a psychological crisis. With the use of dark satire, this tv series surrounds the audience with the \"Twilight Zone\" sensation of a dark and twisted nature. Black Mirror aims to display how advancements in technology will interfere with human nature. Daunting and wicked music aids to transitioning from scene to scene, as the audiences' anticipation grows with each heart beat.\n",
            "Charlie Brooker, the writer and creator of Black Mirror projects the future side-effects of the overuse of technology; under;lying the subject of digital technology and potential within human development. The content of the series covers internal struggles that incorporate a major conflict between humans and nature. As the characters take on pressuring decisions, the audience begins an ongoing or repeated theme of ethics: what is considered wrong, right or honest, for humans to do.\n",
            "Black mirror is an untraditional take on the common debate between the advantages and disadvantages of technology in society. Each individual story within an episode will keep you hooked on a thrilling experience of suspense and emotional trauma.\n",
            "I thought about watching this series for some time and I'm so happy I finally did, because this is what an anthology series at it's best can be. Reminds me a lot of The Outer Limits, which was one of my favorites back in the 90's.\n",
            "Black Mirror is a fascinating way of looking in to the future more or less tongue in cheek. The only reason I'm giving it 9 instead of 10 is that I wish there was more horror elements, but you do get your share of horrible imaginary though. Also the first season as a whole is boring compared to the rest of the seasons. (The Waldo-episode was a complete snoozefest.)\n",
            "The acting is really good. I also love the fact that I get to see familiar actors and actresses like Bryce Dallas Howard or GoT's Jerome Flynn, which also do an amazing job. The special effects are seamless and I wish more series and movies had such a fantastic effects.\n",
            "Many of the episodes come together from the simple idea that technology and social media are consuming us and our world at a fast pace and it's dooming us more or less. I am not myself a huge friend of social media or the latest gadgets so I agree 100%.\n",
            "You should most definitely watch this series, it will make your day!\n",
            "All the episodes are well written and created... dark and twist, some times hardcore and really dark or extreme... but still you can believe that sometime in the future this can happen...Amazing show, I cant wait for new episodes\n",
            "Black Mirror is a unique series in the world of shows. It is futuristic, thought-provoking, deep and sometimes disturbing.(+) Awesome and sleek screenplay and stories(+) Amazing and fitting acting by the episodes' cast(+) Deep, intelligent and futuristic ideas, well developed in each episode(+) Got more dynamic after season 2, with Netflix help(+) Brightly created and produced by Charlie Brooker(+) Memorable episodes, such as 'Be Right Back', 'The Waldo Moment', 'San Junipero', 'Hang the DJ', 'Striking Vipers and 'Smithereens'(-) None that I rememberSo, when you have such a marvel in hand and real demand from viewers' side, you do them a favor and hopefully release up to a potential season 10. Moreover, the seasons are not filled with conveyer-like episodes, so it can be managed with a bit of will and help from the producing side.Hope the above is not wishful thinking as Black Mirror has diamond-like qualities.\n",
            "Each episode builds on a futuristic word where our technology has become highly integrated with our lives. So much so, that many aspects of live have become perverted by the technology. Many of the stories are disturbing from the aspect of human interaction and technological interactions. The graphics are great, the technological ideas are believable, and the acting is great.\n",
            "(This is a review I made for myself to read one day, it is based 100% on my opinion, and should not be taken as a serious criticism)Maybe I love this series so much because it's one of the first ones I watched, and that was part of my personality, it made me think about the time, and every time I watch it I think again, for those who are actually going to watch each episode, I guarantee that at least in one of the episodes you will be able to relate your life, the episodes can be interpreted in different ways, from the most literal as \"he sold himself for money\", to \"He abandoned his own innocence and dreams, because the pressure along with ambition forced her\", and to improve the series, everything takes place in the same universe, for me it will be an eternal 10.\n",
            "\"Black Mirror\" is a science fiction series that opens a window and lets us peek into a future that seems to be getting closer and closer.\n",
            " I´m a fan of this show since it started in 2011 and despite its acquisition by Netflix in Season 3, nothing has been lost in terms of creativity and every episode of this Season 4 continues to offer us stories in a future that feels more and more present. By the way, this is the characteristic that I like the most in this show, the future is strangely familiar and plausible, as if what we are seeing can actually happen in an increasingly technological world that still keeps much of what we know today.\n",
            " Each episode presents us with a new story with new themes and characters, always maintaining the background that characterizes the series, a future that may be more or less black and dystopic and in which we are confronted with the consequences of the use of technology in the evolution of the society and the human being.\n",
            " There are always many and complex questions that stand at the end of each episode and insist on staying in our thoughts. Perhaps because of this, \"Black Mirror\" is a reference to the effect of a TV screen or computer that, when off gives a dark reflection of the viewer.\n",
            " My favorite episode continues to be \"Nosedive\" of Season 3, which shows a society that lives by the rules of a social network and where the success and happiness of each one is decided by the evaluations given by others (it does remind us of something familiar, does it not? ). \n",
            " This season, the episodes \"USS Callister\" and \"Hang the DJ\" are my favorites, the first being a satire to the classic sci-fi shows, full of black humor and that makes us think to what extent virtual clones are conscious beings, and the second a vision of relationships and soul mate search through algorithms of an advanced virtual dating system.Thanks Netflix for having started the year in the best way and I can only hope that this is just the beginning of a 2018 full of such good quality series.\n",
            "GOOD - creativity, innovation, black humor, the ability to surprise, reminiscences of \"The Twilight Zone\", thinking the future\n",
            "BAD - few episodes\n",
            "VERDICT - excellent, a must see\n",
            "Season 7 Different than past seasons, but just as good. This season was a love letter to classic sci-fi and horror, and largely a departure from the insightful exploration of technology's societal implications. Some fans will fault it for not being \"Black Mirror\" enough, but Charlie Brooker (who wrote almost all episodes in all seasons) is still a great writer, and you can see it in season 6 if you are willing to look from a slightly different angle. The same depth, detail, and quality is there, but it's in different places. For example, \"Beyond the Sea\" is an homage to classic 1960's sci-fi books and serials, so it's not about the possible impact of 21st century social media. Instead it is richly filled with themes and details reminiscent of those writings. Similarly, some episodes are more horror than sci-fi, but written and made with the same talent and high standards we saw in the early seasons of \"Black Mirror\". In gratitude for what \"Black Mirror\" gave me in previous seasons, I'm happy to let it lead me down a different path in its final season. I found it almost as satisfying.\n",
            "'Black Mirror' is, in my opinion, a standalone in what it achieves. By exploring the dark side of futuristic technologies it really delves into the uncertainty and fear surrounding technological advancement and the fragility of the human mind. It poses the audience with very real and very relevant questions about where we are and where we're going and whether the progress we're making is truly progress at all. Being an anthology series means that each episode of 'Black Mirror' offers a new and unique experience and story, whilst maintaining the common theme of technological advances. It's exciting because with each new episode you just don't know what you're going to get since they're often written and directed by a different team of people. Luckily, each episode and season benefits from an incredibly strong cast of talented actors that bring to life very real and interesting characters. However, the anthology organisation of the show is a negative as much as it is a positive, since each episode is very hit or miss. There are some episodes that are truly dreadful and that fall completely flat, whilst there are others that are brilliant masterpieces. Which ones are good vs which are bad, will all comes down to individual tastes but personally my favourites are, The Entire History of You, Nosedive, Shut Up and Dance, Hang the DJ, San Junipero, Playtest, Black Museum and White Christmas. Each episode, whether you enjoy it or not, will leave its mark and is very representative of very real issues that we're debating today. Is it right to unnaturally preserve human life? Is it right to monitor your child's every move? Is it right to exploit technology to exact our own justice or revenge? Is it right to create unnatural technologies that defy nature and pose a danger to everyone that uses them? It's these kind of thought provoking and emotive moral dilemmas that 'Black Mirror' tackles with each episode and what makes it so brilliant.\n",
            "This show is absolutely brilliant. There are only a few episodes out of all the seasons that were a little odd but overall the show is amazing! Dark and mysterious every disposes leaves you wondering about those twists endings. Always and favorite and easy to rewatch\n",
            "I don't know what to say but this show is really fascinating. You could realize what will happen in the future is appears in black mirror show\n",
            "Paradoxes of digital age affect us daily, although we may not know it or don't want to admit it. The Black Mirror reflects these paradoxes and possible dangers in an understandable, moderate, appealing way, without unnecessary moralizing or going to extremes.Ideas from each episode, which last \"only\" 40-60 minutes, always sticked with me for several days. Episodes which aired on Netflix are less edgy and more straight to the point than those broadcasted on UK television, but Black Mirror is definitely one of the best drama shows in past decade.\n",
            "All the episodes have a good setup with nice story line. The idea behind the films also makes you will need to think about it. Som episodes are quite close to what is going to happen in the future now. Really like this serie.\n",
            "I love sci-fi. I love horror. I love dark comedies. This show is definitely for me. Most of the ideas are interesting. Most of the episodes are good-great. Some are mediocre or bad. But the reason to watch this show are a few juicy episodes that blew me away. It's incredible storytelling. And I don't mean \"for a show.\" It's in competition with elite movies as well.**************************************************Series 1: 7 stars (2 viewings, 7/9/2023)This season is really good with awesome ideas and great music.

Night Shyamalan movie has a strikingly similar premise, although I liked this episode more than that boring movie.\n",
            "Probably the best show ever made, at least up there, and will probably continue to get better.\n",
            "Can't really write much because I don't think i could do this show justice. Acting great. Directing is great. Writing is great. Because it always a different show every time I could watch 30 seasons. I wish it would last that long. People might not like it but it everything to me that you want a tv show to be.\n",
            "Black mirror shows a world where technology is dominant. Each episode is a unique thriller with the capacity to send chills down the spine which leaves us in a state of thinking and analyzing about the concept they portrayed in it. Every episode is perfect in its own way of depicting the darker side of technology and human nature. It is the darkest series that depicts the events that may happen in the near future. It shows the problems and dangers that come with the advancement of technology through which anyone can do almost anything\n",
            "The best mini series ever seen, all episodes are amazing even some of them seemed Similar but all stories are brilliant , the most episodes i like are ;\n",
            "White Christmas, Hated in the Nation, Men Against Fire, Fifteen Million Merits & White Bear . for now iam waiting for season 4 ,so if you like drama you will see it as a piece of art .\n",
            "The show is great and disturbing! I like how it exaggerates the problems with society and technology and gives a slight glimpse into how things could end up being. Each episode is it's own story line and there is almost always a great plot twist by the end. Although I enjoy the show it is very disturbing and there are times I find it hard to watch. If you do not enjoy twisted stories than this might not be the show for you.\n",
            "The Twilight Zone based in technology rather than Sci fi.That's basically the best way to describe this amazing show. It can be dark, it can be heavy, but more often than not it's very compelling and worth watching.I will say, since this is an anthology, that some episodes will be very different than others. Due to a person's personal taste their favorite/not so favorite episodes may vary dramatically. One of my personal favorites is the second episode, Fifteen Million Merits, yet often times I've seen it in the lower half of people's lists...and that's ok. Each episode will speak to someone in a different way. It's part of the fun.As long as you can handle thoughtful stories that don't always have a happy ending, you won't be disappointed by this series.\n",
            "And im even underestimating this AMAZING show on how the (very nea ) future will be.Very very upsetting but so intresting socially,makes your brain works thats always a plus for me!Apart from this brilliant acting directing music etc.Well done guys!Keep on rocking!\n",
            "This show is a show where the episodes are independent from each other, but share the same deeper meaning. The name \"Black mirror\" comes from the black screen you have on tv's, computers and phones. Every episode, or call it short film, is extremely thrilling and gripping. They are all very intelligent written, and you will be left with a wow-feeling after each episode. It's hard to understand The feeling unless you have seen for yourself!\n",
            "Absolutely brilliant and very well written.The first episode of \"Black Mirror\" is definitely intense to say the least. It provokes a lot of feelings you otherwise wouldn't know could exist in such severity -ranging from intrigue to disgust to pure shock.If you're into disturbing media, this is the one for you. However if you've not got a strong stomach, give it a miss.\n",
            "Overall, it's a great production, except for a few fiasco episodes (two in season 5). Unique in its field.The actors in the series performed very well, although they were not famous. The sights, sounds and atmospheres created were great. It is necessary to congratulate the writers separately. I've said over and over again, \"How can you think of such marginal issues!\" Until season 5, the series had a philosophy created. If they don't leave this, the 6th season can still leave my mouth open.I think it is a very special production. That's why it's a 10-star series.\n",
            "Black Mirror is definitely a well thought out series of different movies in each episode, which is definitely thought provoking; although it can get quite dark.Would love to see an episode, on World War 3, or what would happen if all the nuclear went off.\n",
            "REVIEW - BLACK MIRROR Let me start with a little explanation, Black Mirror is a series made up of separate stories, so from one to another each is different. That being said even though each episode is a different story one thing they have in common is that they are original. Some episodes are scary, some make you think and some are just strange but each is compelling viewing. As each episode is its own story if you don't like the subject of one skip to the next because so far there are 4 series (UK) seasons (US) to watch so I can guarantee you'll find something. Stories original, scary, beautiful, brilliantly acted and a must watch! Rating 10 out of 10\n",
            "I liked it all, its a mind-blowing one.\n",
            "I'd recommend to skip 1st episode of season one then watch the rest, I didn't like season 4 as well.\n",
            "This is an excellent series, each season is quite short, and each episode is an entirely separate story, with different cast and producers, so you can watch the episodes entirely on their own.The red line connecting all episodes is how technological advances in a possibly quite near future might impact our lives. And here the focus is on possible side effects and misuses of the possibilities of new technology.It is many times a journey into the darker sides of humanity in a dystopic future. But also how good intentions of new technology conflicts with our aspirations as good humans to have a loving and meaningful life. There is a wide spectrum of stories in this show, from very emotional love stories to dark sci-fi horror. So there is a very big variation in the episodes. and everyone start watching should find some real golden nuggets to like.Stories are well thought out and seems quite realistic. No overplayed action or violence, you basically just know it is there to take the story forward which is good.The show is really addicting to watch, you just want more of this mind expanding, thought provoking and sometimes frightening and disturbing stories about us as humans in a possible future. An amazing show, masterclass of stories and actors. I really look forward to season 5.\n",
            "I love the tv show it's amazing!\n",
            "Since it's the vivid-19 pandemic & people are addicted to Netflix, why don't you produce an episode related to a virus pandemic in the future?\n",
            "No other show on earth has ever made me feel so disgusted and upset but then can't wait to binge the rest! absolutely brilliant! I wish they made more of them, there are so many other things to write about so I know that is not a problem , the problem is netflix and them footing the bill to them so they can start up Season 6.\n",
            "Brilliant Series. Explores so many concepts, love how every episode has its own moral or lesson. And there are so many brilliant actors. Best UK show in years :)\n",
            "I simply love this show. It's a thinking mans Twilight Zone and I look forward the new season every year.\n",
            "I have just found out Netflix have cancelled the show and I'm devastated\n",
            "Ever since the pilot of the series, I've been utterly hooked to this television concept. Every episode is indeed very dark and very alarming. But, I find myself on the edge of my seat throughout the series, grasping onto each episode's stretched depiction of current technology (horrors). This is a very unusual program, and the controversy is understandable. But, \"Black Mirror\" delivers a significant yet intriguing reality, and makes me rethink our age of technology through each and every episode.\n",
            "I only just recently started to watch Black Mirror, after seeing its name practically everywhere - I know, I know, late to the party by at least a decade.I was pleasantly surprised by the content of this show, and it's refreshing to watch an anthology series, where each episode tells a different story. It makes things a lot easier for casual viewers like me, or people who go back to watch a show after abandoning it for a time. The production, direction and cinematography should be highly praised for such visually dynamic episodes - each bizarrely different from the last, in both good and bad ways.I, for one, think this series is an essential watch that should be on everyone's bucket list. It gets you thinking about the repercussions (and benefits) of technology, digital media and AI (all of which are steadily overtaking the world right this moment).\n",
            "I wanna say thank you to make this kind of series which shows us the real things happening in our world and with our humanity. this series made me to think deeply about the world, about the people we are living with, about me and our humanity. The quality of human being is going down... I heard human beings were the animals (monkey I guess)and now I think human beings are again becoming animals. or may be we are keeping update us (human beings and the world) and something going wrong with this updates.. we need to thing about this and we must do something.\n",
            "So entertaining, touching and deep, helps ppl be wiser and hopefully, make better choices . The ideas in each episode are also genius, cinematography also is good. U should watch it\n",
            "A macabre investigation into the extent that technology can manipulate lives and condition the world people live in; terrifying and personally, absolutely brilliant. Episodes like White Christmas and USS Callister for me are two of the scariest because they present the dangers of replicating human consciousness, which is only one of the foreboding concepts that Black Mirror warns of. What's also satisfying is the great range that the show spans across its episodes which each offer a unique tale, with subtle Easter eggs weaving the anthology together, largely impressive acting and unexpected twists throughout.\n",
            "These episode are all differend, you can start with a random episode. Each episode contains a differend story and that makes it so awesome! I recommend this series for all the people who likes a little mindblow. All the episode has a story in the future, past or present. Pro Tip: Don't give up on the first episode, i found the first one a little bit to much, but on the other hand it was interesting how it can be if it was bassed on a true story.\n",
            "I do not agree with the message for the most part, but most of the stories are thrilling. Even tho not every episode is great most of them are really good.\n",
            "As a kid, I was raised on the Twilight Zone. It is fair to say that Black Mirror is the best series I have come across. Every episode is its own plot with its different cinematography, soundtrack, and characters. It is a series that has perfected their own thought provoking, futuristic, mind blowing screenwriting. Just as Twilight Zone was set in the future, so is Black Mirror. But it is not too radical of a futuristic rendition, rather it is just a small step forward on technology we have today. Black Mirror uses this aspect in ways to engage a emotional connection in its advantageEvery episode is great, Every season is great, we need more! - Ansel Ponce Diama\n",
            "Seasons 1-4 are fantastic and a must see.\n",
            "Bandersnatch was very interesting.On its own, season 5 is watchable. Compared to the previous years however, it's absolute garbage!\n",
            "Wow , just an amazing show , best show on Netflix , each episode is a journey and different story . \n",
            "What makes this show an exceptional is that it's not just the new future technologies but mainly on the human nature and their interaction with this technologies .\n",
            "Black Mirror need more recognition in the Awards galas like The Emmy and The Golden Globe , Charlie Brooker is a genius producer and screenwriter .\n",
            "Absolutely on of the best series i've ever watched. One word: BRILLIANT!\n",
            "Looking forward to seeing more episodes of Black Mirror!\n",
            "These will really be, is truly an amazing show. That the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society.\n",
            "14 of the 19 episodes so far have been brilliant, in my opinion. It is a British high tech version of the Twilight Zone of the early 60's.\n",
            "Know what episodes to avoid and this is the best single-episode show of all time.\n",
            "I've watched this episode and its shocking in its brilliance. I'm sure to have nightmares tonight. OMG\n",
            "The tv show is great and very well constructed. Cool plot and originality but...\n",
            "for people with anxiety like me it's quite hard. it intensifies and triggers anxiety a lot and there should be a warning.\n",
            "Loved the four previous seasons of Black Mirror. (TBH, I didn't get all the way through Season One Episode One, and I would suggest that potential viewers start after this particular episode.) The first four seasons were elevated Twilight Zone episodes (high praise from me). Watched the first two episodes of Season Five and they were subpar. Easy to see the twists. But I will give the rest of the season a try. If you want something well done in the same vein as S5 E2, please watch Get Out! by Oscar winning Jordan Peele. (Can't give enough praise for this film.) But, as I said, I am continuing to watch the rest of the season. (Yeah, maybe I should have waited to post after watching the entirety of this season.)\n",
            "Simply amazing. Most episodes have really interesting ideas that pick up on the technology currently used and just take it up a notch as to its use in the future. The plot twists at the end of some episodes made my spine tingle, while some gave a really uncomfortable feelingIf it wasn't for the really bad season 5 and a mediocre season 4, it would have been a 10\n",
            "Great series ever. Recommend for who love of the idea of the technology and future world.\n",
            "Black Mirror is sci-fi high on shrooms: a very thought-provoking show, that will leave you with strong and very different thoughts and emotions after watching each episode. Some episodes will uplift you, some will depress you. I personally cannot binge watch Black Mirror because it is just so draining to watch. Each episode induces you to reflect on your humanity, your personal life, how you deal with society, how technology affects your connection to society, the future of technology, and many other things.Each episode is a stand-alone episode (but is said to be occurring in one cinematic universe) so you can jump episodes and seasons (except for the last episode of season 4-- watch that last). Different episodes have different characters (and I think writer and creators).Black Mirror is the modern version of the Twilight Zone. It combines various genres in a predominantly sci-fi theme, while providing a utopian or (mostly) dystopian satire of humanity's technology-dependent present and future.I highly recommended that you watch this show, especially if you belong to the young generation (after the Millenials) who were born with all this \"high technology\" we now depend on. Just be patient with season 1 because that's a pilot season-- most pilot seasons usually are just building the series' steam.\n",
            "Black Mirror impressively ties together its standalone episodes, hinting at shared elements that keep viewers engaged in the same universe. This smart storytelling allows each episode to shine on its own while subtly suggesting connections to previous stories. It's like connecting the dots in a complex puzzle, creating a cohesive narrative world that viewers can immerse themselves in.Each episode of Black Mirror sparks deep thinking, encouraging viewers to ponder the \"what if\" scenarios that are at the heart of science fiction. By exploring the potential impacts of new technologies, the show prompts us to consider how they might shape society and individuals. This mix of imagination and social commentary is what makes Black Mirror so fascinating to watch and discuss.The unsettling storyline of S3EP5 serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by government overreach, leaving viewers feeling uneasy and suspicious of authority. It's a wake-up call about the risks of surveillance and manipulation, leaving a lasting impression. As the series progresses, it delves into darker themes, exploring the complexities of human nature and technological progress.With each season, Black Mirror continues to push boundaries, delivering moments that provoke strong emotional reactions. Whether it's intense scenes of violence or shocking plot twists, the show keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. It's a thrilling roller coaster ride, leaving audiences both captivated and unsettled by its thought-provoking insights.\n",
            "Created in 2011 by Charlie Brooker, it's a series who includes a different types like horror, sci-fi, thriller and drama.\n",
            "It's an English series. This one talks about the impact of the new technology in our life.Each episodes are independent. There is no order between them.\n",
            "For example, the episode \"nosedive\" the most realistic in the series, show a fictive world where everybody gives a rating using their phones.\n",
            "I like this episode because it seems crazy to live in this world, to depend of the rating for the work, activities, earn apartment ...\n",
            "If you have a bad rating, you can't do this things.\n",
            "Bryce Dallas Howard who's playing the main characters gives a fantastic performance.\n",
            "Concerning the realization of this part, the director wants to show us a perfect world with a catchy music and pastels colors.However, \"Hang the DJ\" is less interesting than the others, because it seems too long and too confuse. The plot talks about only a date between two persons.\n",
            "The ending of this part doesn't come across convincing.In conclusion, I really recommend this series because there is a twist on every episodes. That's what makes this series unique.\n",
            "It will change the way you see the new technology.\n",
            "It's a must on Netflix, don't miss it!!!!\n",
            "I just love this show. Nothing makes you think like Black Mirror.It's definitely not for everyone, but if you manage to look past the bizarreness, pig f***ing etc. you're in for a treat. I've had hours and hours of debates with friends about the show. Sharing and hearing opinions about the episodes is the best, because people notice different things and have different takeaways from each. It broadens your horizons and gives you a new perspective on life and the future.SEASON 4\n",
            "It's a shame it had to go mainstream and everything is now feeble and watered down for the masses. I know it can be f***ed up at times, but I actually watch BM for the bizarreness and the pig f***ing.Half of the episodes just didn't make sense (memories from DNA?) and the other half had weak twists or flat endings. Before this season, everything was outrageous, but believable and maybe not too far off into the future. Now it just doesn't make sense.I expected more from BM this season and it didn't live up to it, but it's still the best show I've ever watched.\n",
            "Favorite Season: 3\n",
            "Favorite Episode: Shut Up and Dance (Radiohead, duh)\n",
            "This is definitely a quality series where each series is a different story with its own concept and actors. Some series are definitely very interesting, some are ordinary, some are not particularly interesting, but the desire to continue watching remains all the same.As a rule, each series has a well-developed plot with an interesting idea that fits into one series. The cast is always different, and sometimes there are famous actors, and they all play well. Everything is done at an excellent level.Of course, each series with different stories and directing can not just be for everyone, so something will look uninteresting.The series is worthy of attention. Everyone will be able to find an interesting series with the problems revealed in them, and in case of what just skip the uninteresting series without any consequences to watch the next series.\n",
            "From the prime minister's pajamas and dignitaries' uniforms, it reveals a thick black color, and the last section is like a state of war, which makes my back cool! E02 when he used his life to say the declaration of resistance, he finally surrendered to the society that had been corroded by consumerism. Isn't this our life now and in the future? E03 when you can freely view the memories and enlarge their analysis, you will never get out.\n",
            "This is one of the best Netflix shows I watched so far. It is really terrifying that all of these episodes of Black Mirror can be or is already applicable in real life. I really enjoy learning about the philosophy in each episode where everyone has to make a choice based on their moral judgments. Whenever I watch an episode, I feel my eyes would explode with shockness. Tik tok is the reason on how I got into this show on Netflix. Without TikTok, I wouldn't know about the show. This is how a good show should be like. I am glad this show exists. I remember having a weird dream and it reminds me of black mirror.\n",
            "The sci-fi TV series starting with a horrendously disturbing episode yet turning out to be a minimalistic accent tv series is such a likable one which is indeed unique in itself. Every episode is not interrelated to each other and each episode till date is up to the mark to be called a black mirror episode. The characters is really intense and have been appealing enough to leave a mark despite having around an hour of screen time. The stories are well written, and the direction is par excellence. Not to forget the cinematography, it never fails to attract, yet is a bit not equally good in a few episodes. The solo one hour episode with no relation to any background story nor requiring an explanation ultimately immersing the viewer in the story makes this show stand aside.This show has indeed been one of my favorites and every episode has portrayed the sad yet actual face of our society which how in future could turn out to be a nightmare. This series also shows the beautiful impact of trchtechno on human lives, how it being crucial can some day turn out to be a bizzare spoilt mistake. This series in literal metaphorical term, is a mindbender.\n",
            "Excellent near-time Futurama of tech intersecting everyday society. Think original Twilight Zone with the thought-provoking ambiguity replaced by existing or near-future technology. Immediately alarming and insightful. As a technologist and father myself, the series easily captures your attention with solid acting and directing through intriguing story-telling that will stay with you beyond the episode's end.\n",
            "TBH , My honest opinion is to stay away from this series as it will induce doubts and have questions on your very existence and life.. It did spark something inside me which i dont think will never ever leave. Its not bad ... its so wonderful and thought provoking on life and many other dark stuffs of life, its best avoided...\n",
            "Brooker is a god! Some of the best TV Ever in my eyes. Gripping and dark.\n",
            "It is very funny what happens when some people see the worst side of life, the worst side/version of themselves in front of their eyes. Black Mirror is definately an heir to The Twilight Zone, The X-files, Outer Limits etc. It is almost pure Sci-Fi but based on the truths of our world today. It is disturbing, it is frustrating, it is pesimistic (except one episode, find out which), it is a guide-suggestion, on what to avoid so as not to turn technology/science into a freaking waking nightmare. I don't like doing this but in this case I think it is imperative: People, my fellow reviewers... each episode is a \"stand alone\"! Different stories every episode. There is no continuity from ep to ep! That is the show format. For crying out loud, please!Black Mirror is Hu-Man in the Mirror. The Mirror is Science/technology. It is up to us to de-black it. Make that Change.\n",
            "Black Mirror is a British anthology series created by Charlie Brooker. While each episode presents a different world with different characters, all of them have a common underlying theme - the dark side of technology. In this review, I am going to discuss aspects of this TV series that makes it my favorite of all time.Firstly, the show has the ability of presenting a very depressing, dystopian world that could actually happen in present time. This aspect makes the viewing experience much more terrifying. The characters presented are also three-dimensional and have a lot of nuance on them. This makes the audiences care and feel invested on them. Moreover, the high production values adds an extra layer of realism to the world since it looks very realistic. Additionally, the stories teaches a lot of moral lessons that audiences can learn. Last but not least, the great cinematography presents a visceral experience as every shot is composed beautifully, with a slow creeping camera movement and many wide shots.It is a revolutionary piece of television that will stand the test of time and be remembered years from now.\n",
            "Black mirror will go down as one of my all time favourite shows. The story of each episode so twisted but yet believable is hard to describe untill your 30 mins into an episode and glued to the screen. The technology aspect is so clever and imaginative and has you hooked from the first second. ABSOULTY AVOID SEASON 5. (Would have been a 10 otherwise)This is my first ever review and I wrote it purely from my frustration of season 5. Another show destroyed from lazy writing and no character depth What so ever... Has to improve\n",
            "Black Mirror is a show that provides the important modern question that is very meaningful especially in this day and age. \"Can technology go 'too' far?\" To put it very simply, it's sort of a modern form of the Twilight Zone. The show is easier to comprehend if you treat each episode as it's own separate universe. It has somewhat of a formula. Each episode, there is a problem. However, there is a piece of new tech that perfectly tackles the problem. Or so you think. Unseen consequences come with this tech, creating a problem equal to/ worse than before. For a show that sometimes follows such a basic formula, the plot is always fresh, new, and most importantly, interesting and thought provoking.There's a sort of unique feeling you get while you're watching Black Mirror. A mixture of horror along with the morbid intrigue of watching a car accident. A wonderfully constructed car accident at that. The further you go, the more horrified you are, but at the same time, are presented with a plot that unfolds brilliantly. The only preventing me from giving this a 10/10 was the fact some episodes were slightly dull in production. In any other show it would've been a good episode, however in the standards that Black Mirror sets within itself, some were lackluster. Also, this show does not appeal to all. This is clearly visible even in this review section. There are either 8-10 ratings or 1-3 ratings. It's like geometry. You either like it, or you don't. Of course, there are complaints in this review section. A common complaint is about the first episode. In the first episode there is a scene where the Prime Minister is forced to rape a pig. That scene of course was very obscene. And I can imagine a good amount of people were disgusted by that. They immediately saw the scene, exited out of the Netflix and probably ranted online about how bad it was. They accuse Black Mirror of relying purely on shock value alone. This is far, far from the truth. The whole episode was to show how someone can influence a population with a few posts online, and how effective it can be. They essentially criticized Mob Mentality, showing how flawed it really is. If you cannot find a pretty clear message from a television show which explicitly states it's lesson, you're probably a bit to young to watch this show.\n",
            "Wonderful heart touching short stories, Each one can explain how that the human being is the wildest animal on the earth\n",
            "The Netflix series Dark threatened to remove Black Mirror from being my number one series of all time,but they destroyed the ending worse than Lost did,so here we are. Still on the Throne. This is our future and we are closer to it day by day.\n",
            "What hooked me into the show was the first episode,the same that repelled so many people. From me it's an eternal 10. I see many hating on the 5th season,i loved it the same as all before,especially the second episode with Andrew Scott which is in my top 3 episodes. Everything evolves,people. Us,the creator of the show,the show. And time.\n",
            "Only episode I couldn't bear was the first one with the pig. Other then that it's an amazing show with superb actors and the special effects are tremendous. I love the idea of a new story in every episode. With this show you always think you know what's going to happen but you really don't and it's amaxing.\n",
            "Great stories and music. Love that all eps are so different yet the same show.The tech advances are essential and just make your mind blow!Hated in the nation was great. The bee episode. Great twists!!! Seen it a few times.San juniper or similar also a very good plot and twist.The ep where the American backpacker goes to the creepy English country house was very good but scary. I could watch with sound. I know I'd have got right out of there. Another good twist at the end but made me sad.And FYI he is Goldie hawn and Kurt Russell's son.The ep striking vipers was good and also a thinker of what we could do if we could. The best bros thing was awkward.Mickey Cyrus ep also good. But the villains didn't get enough karma for me.\n",
            "I was recommended an episode by my 14 year old son and I am hooked. It reminded me of a twilight zone episode and now he's hooked. How have I scrolled past this the last 6-7 years??? (Twilight Zone music plays in the background)\n",
            "As black mirror is an anthology series, it's better to watch individual episodes rather than binge it, as they don't really connect and watching them in one go can detract from the message. Incredibly poignant, sometimes to a fault, yet ultimately engaging storytelling. As the series progresses, it becomes repetitive and monotone, which was bound to happen. However there is no doubt that some episodes in there are some of the most unique and engrossing pieces of television I have seen.\n",
            "It's one of those shows that you can't stop watching bc your mind is going to be wrecked and intrigued with every episode. The casting is amazing no matter what side of the pond you are on.\n",
            "Great show, amazing actors, interesting and original plot lines, I can't get enough of this show. It definetly fills the deep empty longing that I had for a show similar to the Twilight Zone that I loved as a kid. The only negative for me is that I have to wait for new episodes after bingeing the first 4 seasons.\n",
            "What a truly brilliant series! \"Nosedive\" is a masterpiece. Just skip season 5 please.\n",
            "This show provides a thought-provoking look into the dark side of technology. Many episodes are set in the plausible near-future, with some of the technologies actually not too far off from real-world current technologies.Some of the episodes are kind of dark, but they end up doing a great job of provoking thought. I found myself asking, \"what would I do in that situation?\"\n",
            "Thrilling, suspenseful, very well acted, well written. Would highly recommend!!IMDB needs to fix their app for submitting a review.\n",
            "I love thats its always something new in every episode. Makes me think about the future and the different paths that us as people and science can go which i love. And i hope to see more seasons to come!!\n",
            "Black Mirror is a reality check. It is not a feel-good show, but manages to redeem its perturbing quality with its penetrating insight and indictment of mainstream society. It's m.o. is poignantly portraying and exploring the role technology is playing in our present through a series of futuristic, somewhat hyperbolized sci-fi scenarios where society has arguably mal-adapted to technological advance. The thing is despite the futuristic setting, the show resonates intensely with the now, I guess, as good sci-fi should do. A sample of themes from season one:-How absurdity, grotesqueness, and even violence have been trivialized to the extent of becoming entertainment at times. How trauma, depicted so readily on screens these days, has become something to watch primarily for stimulation. How, in many ways, we've become sadistic spectators or at best desensitized unconcerned bystanders. -How a system that commodifies human life and energy (particularly lower and middle- class human life and energy) i.e. \"a dead-end job\" is maintained by aloof sociopathic elites through the brainwashes of materialism, distraction, and dream- selling. AND how society is complicit in this basically by being satisfied with the comfort of minimal needs being met, no matter how vapid and mundane this renders their life. -How perfect memory, its storage, and recollection can be a double-edged sword. In a society where everyone has a brain implant that records and stores all audiovisual aspects of an individual experience for playback (and projection for all to see) at any moment, what issues will arise? How would you use it? To what extent would you relive your pains, your pleasures? To what extent would you fact-check your friends, family members, and lovers? To what extent would you chase clarity on events that happened outside of your experience, since you know an accessible recording exists in another person? The subsequent seasons continue to tackle various heady and humane issues connected in some way with advanced technology (e.g. hacking, terrorism, virtual/augmented reality, racism, social media addiction, manipulated consciousness). Every episode is its own mental trip, has a twist, and most leave you with a sense of psychological vertigo. This probably isn't a show you want to binge-watch because, again, it isn't a feel good show due to its existential tone (even though it has some truly funny parts and scattered gems in the dialogue). But it IS a show that engrosses your mind and gut, and compels you to watch every episode. I like to think this show is like medicine: sometimes hard to palate, but necessary. I took off a star only because some of the endings frustrate far more than they satisfy which, all considered, might be the point. Great show. Highly recommend.\n",
            "The 4th season might've not been so black mirror-ish, but it still shows the dark side of technology as intended. Though it may lean more towards style over substance in more than one case, Black Mirror still finds plenty of opportunities to perplex and depress\n",
            "The most mind blowing show with so many plot twists and stuff. The first few seasons are absolutely perfect especially the episodes with british casting. Every episode is like a different storyline that showcases the dangers of technology progressing. Black mirror does a great job at making a viewer feel close to a character then showing who they really are at the end. White bear shocked me. Some of the episodes are much better than others but the only episode i really dislike is the miley cyrus one its so cringe sorry. Anyway would be 10/10 if it didnt have a few snooze fest episodes but trust you gotta watch black mirror!!\n",
            "How anyone could rate this lower then a 10 is beyond me. Amazing writing, actors, filming. It has it all. It will blow your mind and make you think about things you've probably never thought to think about. Absolutely amazing and impatiently waiting for the next season because I can never get enough!\n",
            "This is one of those series where you just have to push past that first episode to get sucked in completely. I agree with those who were offended, and I almost turned back, but I had the same experience at some point early in Breaking Bad, and we all know how that one went down. And although I was horrified by the first episode, I have to say that it actually was one of the post powerful and on target ones that deal with the dark power of social media. The writers are fearless. Black Mirror is one of the shows that I most anticipate the next season. And I love anthologies. There are not enough of them out there.\n",

            "I have to say, it's easy for me to like something, but to blow me away, that's something else. This show, I binged watched when I was on my trip to Spain, and I remember thinking about this constantly throughout the whole trip. I couldn't even focus watching a flamenco show in Seville because I was thinking about the first episode of this show. This show is a masterpiece, and it takes a lot of intelligence from someone to make this kind of masterpiece. I have to say though, I couldn't finish San Junipero because It was such a cliche. But the other episodes were amazing. Even if I don't like San Junipero, I can admire the work put behind it. Therefore I can proudly say I have never been even close to disappointed with this show.\n",
            "Some episodes are good ... some are bad. Some episodes will make you want to turn back in time because you've wasted an hour watching a boring one.However , the episodes that are good are cleverly thought out and really does scare you because of the reality of the situations.\n",
            "At it's heart \"Black Mirror\" is a scifi show using elements of reality and fiction to create believable worlds and characters. If an episode is not pushing the boundaries of ethics and morality: it is creating fictitious glimpses into near futures that are wholly entertaining.The first 2 seasons are short and might put people off with it's Anglo centric storytelling. Seasons 1 & 2 appeal more to a British audience but if you stick it out until Season 3 the storytelling broadens to include a more predominant American presence to it's characters and storytelling.My only criticism of the show is that conflicts within a character are often left unresolved by the end of an episode, leading people to review \"Black Mirror\" as a bleak or dark description of a fictitious future.Definitively worth watching/buying on DVD.\n",
            "Amazing TV series which amazingly depicts the the realistic part of how science and technology is taking over over life rapidly and what happens when technology is taken for granted. This TV gives a glimpse of near reality and how things can get so intense that technology can itself become a dark reality than something which makes our life easier.\n",
            "Charlie Booker has created a real master piece.\n",
            "Black mirror can't be define with words. Every episode leave you with a lot of reflections\n",
            "This show is one of the best I've seen lately. It makes you think about arguable topics, and whether we should continue the technological developing trend or not. I also like the depressive settings which contributed to your involvement in this show. After episode 1 I could not stop watching anymore because it really intrigues me. However, not all episodes do play on your feelings the same. Some are much more personal than others, however, overall it did a great job and makes one really think about it.All by all, I think each episode (I watched until now) was a masterpiece by itself and made me eager for more. The show also includes many innovative ideas which I think are also very interesting.\n",
            "The first 3 seasons were amazing , not able to find the right word to explain it . and waiting very impatiently , I am now on 4th episode but still waiting for the past seasons effects . hv not able to find it yet , but I am such hopefull about it , because it is still one of my favourite series\n",
            "Black Mirror is the anthology series we've been wanting the UK to make in a very long time. Each episode is a self-contained story that could EASILY be used for episodes of shows like Doctor Who and such. The thing that makes Black Mirror so good is its exploration of futuristic utopias, how technology affects the world when we've reached a breaking point, and it's got the open-ended anthology nature of The Twilight Zone. It's basically a contemporary equivalent of Twilight Zone for the 2010s.I love Black Mirror. I discovered it when Netflix revived the series in 2016, and the stories it tells are interesting and unsettling. Is all that happens in the world of Black Mirror the right thing to do? Do the character even know the difference between right and wrong? See this show asap. It's not going to fizzle anytime soon; but get a Netflix account if you don't have one already.\n",
            "I love Black Mirror. Its been one of the best shows on TV since it began. (Can we call it TV now?) Not every episode is perfect. But its always entertaining and thought provoking. Its never lazy or formulaic. Its always imaginative and provocative.What I don't understand is that it seems people are quite down on Season 5 and I don't get why. Sure, I would not say any of them are as good as the very best episodes like San Junipero, White Christmas, Shut Up and Dance etc. But also I wouldn't say any of them are as bad as the worst.Smithereens was the best of the three IMO. Andrew Scott was superb as always. And the story was heart-wrenching. But its the Miley Cyrus episode that seems to be coming under fire the most. Now I'm no Miley fan, but I thought she equipped herself well in this and was perfectly cast. One thing people seem to be saying is that this episode 'Rachel, Jake and Ashley Too' was cliche and a trite portrayal of the music business. All I would say to that (and I work in the music business), is that those criticisms come from people who have forgotten the idea of a metaphor. Yes, if the story was just saying Rock is real and Pop is contrived then that would be both a lazy cliche and inaccurate. But to assume that you would have to ignore that Charlie Brooker is never that simplistic and never that lazy as a writer. So think harder, dig deeper and perhaps you will find more than meets the eye. This series is not, never has been nor never will be for lazy viewers.\n",
            "I just watched NOSEDIVE episode. And I almost cried. I watched every mayor show that is runned in the last 20 years and this one, well, this one is different. All business about the tv shows, movies are went to s..t long time a go, it's all just making money and repeating endlessly same old patterns, same trick, red herrings, stories, bla bla, you name it. But this show is smart, really smart, and different and I mean like really different. It's a glimpse into a possible future, a warning, a questioning what are we f...cking doing, we humans, beautifull and god made. Sorry for bad english and mistakes, I'm drunk a little and english is not my native language. Anyway, if you want something that's different, smart, perfectly executed, and will make you think about humanity and your own soul, just watch it, you will not regret it...\n",
            "Black Mirror presents to the public, with sci-fi and drama stories, the consequences of technology evolution in a future society. Created by Charlie Brooker, the British TV show won the International Emmy Award in 2012 as the best TV show in the year.Presenting a completely different plot for each episode, the series, divided into 4 seasons, uses issues of our actual society mixed with future technologies and how the people would use it. The most stories approach dark themes, insisting to make a reflection about artificial intelligence and the ethical issues about it. Despite the sci-fi side, we can relate each plot treated with nowadays issues and really see in this memorable TV show a mirror of our society and people's reactions. The viewer can put himself in the character's place and try to imagine what choice would take in each situation.Using a mind blowing scene in the end of the episodes, Black Mirror makes you stop and think about right and wrong, where we will be and what we will be doing in the future, how the technology can affect us. All this context is perfect for the sci-fi lovers, who would easily spend all day long to watch all seasons in sequence.\n",
            "Is it possible that a show can be every emotion ever felt by a human being all at once? Well, Black Mirror definitely proves so. One of the most impressive series of the recent times, it becomes with a strong mix of stories. The creators have obviously spent a lot of time curating these stories to make for thrilling seasons one after the other. I am particularly happy and satisfied with the consistency of the episodes. I love how each one of them (and the Directors are to be credited for that, of course) can simply engulf you and make you a part of the story within just a few mins. At several occasions, I have found myself so connected to the characters. The production value is also excellent. You do really start believing what you see because everything looks so convincing. I do hope that this series does not stop for a long long long time!\n",
            "If you've ever thought about the world and where it's possibly heading, this is your show. If you've ever thought at all, this is your show. True art of our time.\n",
            "I am a new IMDB user, usually I rate TV series, movies, by just giving it a rating to my friends or recommend it to them. But Black Mirror is a different story, oh yes. This piece of art here, deserves much more of my attention, and I mean a lot more. Currently I am in Season 4, Episode 3, but I have plenty of reasons to write this review. I accidently started with season 4 episode 1. Didn't know what the hell was going on, but it was good so I decided to watch Episode 1 season 1. And it was an entire different story, a different setting. At the end of it, I was just blown away. While I thought that the entire series was based on what I saw in s4 episode 1. It showed me how powerful these episodes are, that even one single episode could make me watch an entire TV show of it. And that's what Black Mirror delivers, it delivers great mini-movies. Black Mirror tries to hold a mirror infront of you, or someone around you. Some of it may confront you with personality traits that you own. It also shows that science evolves faster than our own instincts and how to deal with science when it's combined with desires in general. Making us question if technology is a step forwards or a step backwards. If you haven't watched Black Mirror, then wait no longer! You have no idea how great this TV show is. It's a rare piece of art that is hard to come by. The only thing that will be saddening for me, is what the hell will I watch after this? To me no other TV show can actually compete let alone be compared to what this art is.A big fat 10/10 for me!\n",
            "It is more like a bunch of movies brought together by the same theme: technology. Every eposode is different and special in its own way. Loved it.\n",
            "This is absolutely one of the best TV series I've been watching for years.Too bad that each season is surprisingly short on number of episodes.Great work! And also great acting, overall.A must see!\n",
            "Quite simply this show is an example of why it's worth watching television. Supremely talented writers with an ever improving budget and wealth of great acting talent creating satire and poking holes and turning our own reality, values and ideas about the world on its head. This quite simply can not be missed, I've rewatched almost every episode multiple times. It's the rarity of a thoroughly enjoyable from a dark comedy and cerebral slice of modern world reflection.\n",
            "The anthology series is based on the premise that in the futuristic world where despite mind blowing high-tech stuff, humans still end up more miserable than they were before. It makes you question (you know similar to whether robots are good, aliens are friends?) whether we want that kind of \"cool\" or seemingly interesting techs around us.If you can digest the above premise than you are in for a heck of a ride. The writing & cast is so brilliant, you get immersed in each episode almost as if living in that world. The series delivers episode after episode its dark thrilling tales that gets you engrossed completely.I am not giving out any spoilers but would recommended highly for people who are a fan of \"out of the box\" concept stories...\n",

            "If Ray Bradbury wrote episodes of the Twilight Zone set on the cutting edge of near-future technology, it would be Black Mirror. You won't feel good after watching an episode. You will think and you may even cry. It's deep and intense and disturbing. That's the whole point. If you enjoy pondering the moral dilemmas of our modern age, you'll appreciate this show.\n",
            "Black Mirror, for me, went through a different phase each season. I will use these phases as building blocks to review the series as a whole. Start-up: At this point, the series was new, wild, very confronting and, unfortunately, completely unknown to the outside (read: non-BBC) world. Everything was right. The creator had an idea and he made it happen on the small screen. In my opinion, the best episodes were created in this season for just that reason. While underrated, the brilliance caused the series to earn a second season. Growth: This is when I picked up on the series because it got better and more reviews overall. I really enjoyed every episode except the very first one and I could only hope for more brilliance from the creators. The writing was excellent and the concept was still incredibly cool and unique. Maturity: The series achieved its peak with the White Christmas episode. The show got a broader fanbase and Netflix decided to throw money into the concept to scale it up to six episodes a season. This was the moment I, and with me probably many more, got very excited for the future of the series. However, the new episodes were still enjoyable but every fan knew this was not the rebellious and brilliant series it used to be. It lost its touch with its core, which mostly showed in the unusually happy episode San Junipero. Don't get me wrong, that episode was brilliant, but not as 'Black Mirror' as the striking episodes in the beginning (like Five Million Merits) used to be. Decline: I watched the fourth season right when it came out, and I let it sink in for a few months before I wanted to write this review. There was not a single episode that got me on the edge of my seat, and there was not a single episode that really got me thinking. What I loved about Black Mirror was the challenge it gave us to look differently at (all our behavior with) technology. However, this season, more than ever, let the good guys win, had inexplicable and unreasonable plots (instead of technology, it were the people causing bad events) or it was outright not 'black' at all (Hang The DJ, which I will review separately because of its wasted potential). For me, Black Mirror has ended. It was great as long as it lasted. But every great concept like this was great because it was what it was at the time: a niche. A niche talking to a specific audience that wants to be challenged. When Netflix wants to produce more episodes in a shorter time window, it comes at a cost. The cost of the niche that I valued so much at the beginning of the series. So right now, it is time to find a new niche series to enjoy.\n",

            "We can agree or disagree with how the writer sees the issues, but I think the issues are already there.\n",
            "There is plenty of homage to go around to the best of sci-fi prognositicators, I would mention the creator of Twilight Zone, Rod Serling, and I would mention Philip K. Dick as a mentor as well. But Charlie Brooker works them into the perceptions of NOW.\n",
            "This is nothing short of excellent. It is intelligent above all, and I think that is the most attractive feature. The concepts addressed in this show are deep and meaningful; the sort of things we should all take time to contemplate in our daily lives. I especially love that each episode is a different story exploring a different scenario - its refreshing and engaging, at times making you feel as if you are experiencing everything first-hand, because the protagonist in each tale is someone we can all relate to. I really hope more and more people get to see this. A deep thank you to the creators and contributors!\n",
            "Ingenious writing of the highest form. One of, if not the best, series I have ever watched. Every episode gifts the viewer with the element of surprise, not only in terms of subject, but through the unfolding of the unique plot as well. A trait very rare in today's ocean of diluted series, whom often do not have the intellectual ability to achieve total unpredictability as well keep the viewer enslaved to their screens (ironically) from start to finish. While I selfishly would love for more episodes to a season, I understand that this is what will doom the show. Black Mirror is, indeed, a case of quality over quantity with its ingenious concepts and authentic story lines.\n",
            "I had no expectations starting this series nor had i any idea of what it was about. Ever episode brings something new and always blows my mind away. At least for the first two seasons and the Christmas special. This show brings out the worst aspects of the human race and blows it out of proportion. That is what makes this show so disturbing yet so entertaining. I am one who loves disturbing shows with an intelligent story, and this show is perfect. I like the fact that ever episode is independent from one another, this widens the reach of the show, being able to cover many topics and different aspects. The pacing is great, screenplay is wonderful and the direction is on point for the most part. with that being said, the third season was slightly disappointing. i'm not saying that the latest season was bad. it's just nowt as good as the previous seasons. i did not find the latest season (3rd season) as intelligent or as disturbing as the previous ones. however, it did improve in the direction and the screenplay. overall, this is still one of m favorite series of all time.\n",
            "Sci-Fi which high technology gives a thrilling ride with amazing VFX ,not all episodes r gud bt many r just amazing n a treat to watch , it's d first interactive show ever which make it more watchable if u watch bandersnatch\n",
            "This show puts a spin on modern and futuristic (not so distant future too) technology and how it is impacting our culture as a whole. How we as a people view it and each other as a result of our attachment to that technology. It makes you turn back on yourself and say \"I could really see that happening someday\" in some and \"oh man, I do that all the time!\" in others. Kind of reminds me of how The Outer Limits was done back in the 90's just re-imagined for today's viewer, there is some message to be understood from each one. Each episode is completely different than the last, constantly keeping you on your toes while still keeping things fresh and new. My only request is that they get some more funding so we can start getting longer seasons!\n",
            "Black Mirror - season 3 - Episode 1 - White Christmas is by far the craziest audiovisual trip in a long time. A Twist most likely to those times of Master David Lynch himself. I mean I see here influences from so many films, TV series, but put those influences all together in one episode is a riddle of not so many. To what levels do you let your mind go? Is that enough to write about it? Is that good to film it? Do you think people will pay for that? What do you wanna show? What do you want them to know? Do you think you can handle the story out? Right from the beginning? Well, think again... Black mirror makes you wonder. Wonder more. Black mirror is a blend of crucial elements in order to lift off from your mind, your most intense stimulus and feeling. it is unbelievable wise - outrageous\n",
            "Season 6 are different than past seasons, but just as good. Season 6 was a love letter to classic sci-fi and horror, and largely a departure from the insightful exploration of technology's societal implications. Some fans will fault it for not being \"Black Mirror\" enough, but Charlie Brooker (who wrote almost all episodes in all seasons) is still a great writer, and you can see it in season 6 if you are willing to look from a slightly different angle. The same depth, detail, and quality is there, but it's in different places. For example, \"Beyond the Sea\" is an homage to classic 1960's sci-fi books and serials, so it's not about the possible impact of 21st century social media. Instead it is richly filled with themes and details reminiscent of those writings. Similarly, some episodes are more horror than sci-fi, but written and made with the same talent and high standards we saw in the early seasons of \"Black Mirror\". In gratitude for what \"Black Mirror\" gave me in previous seasons, I'm happy to let it lead me down a different path in it. I found it almost as satisfying.\n",
            "Seriously , this is one of must watch, i dont have to say. If you watch at least 2 epis. No one can stop you from watching the whole series.since this is an anthology , you wont just stick to the same characters either , which is pretty cool and fresh . This show is the future literary.\n",
            "if it had more episode it would beat breaking bad, walking dead ,daredevil even game of thrones .i don't know why it is not one most famous TV series ever created.features speculative fiction with dark and sometimes satirical themes that examine modern society, particularlywith regard to the unanticipated consequences of new technologies.it takes you to edge of dark human nature and in awkward scenario in which people may exhibit so extreme behavior.its a must watch if you liked GOT, BB ,TWD ,daredevil like me ... you will love it like me .a different stuff that rest of them all combined . each episode with a new theme . no connection between episodes.\n",
            "Ok so it's now 2023 and I'm catching-up with this but for 2011 it's got a lot of crazy predictions which truly did happen and are spookingly accurate.Unfortunately if I wrote down how accurate they are people may not believe me but British people definitely see the similarities.Brexit is talked about and it's 100% accurate even though when it was casted and filmed it was all what-if scenarios.It's got some extremely edgy scenes which are not required for family-viewing. The darkness is relentless. The humour and satire shines.It's brilliantly-written and the dialogue is incredible intense. It's go a stellar casting and the dystopian future is portrayed at a level of AI one is not ready for yet. But it could be so incredible realistic and believable with our mesmerising advances in recent years.However to save and store all that data is just incredible and that as well as human rights and legal issues is why these dystopias are still dystopias and will probably not happen.The direction is quality. I feel like I'm present in every episode. The cinema is strong. Great close-ups of ferocious on-screen arguments which really boil over and make me wonder if something extremely grave will occur at every nano-second when the pressure point occurs.It's an excellent thrill-ride and I'm very surprised of the reviewing figures on IMDB. I thought it would be much more. It's brilliant and we need much more fresh TV such as this. Excellent work! Didn't want to provide spoilers; just watch it!\n",
            "Black Mirror takes a step forward in looking at the darker side of technology and social trends to a level of creativity I have not seen before. With each episode being it's own story, there are some losers in there. That being said, the concept is so good I have to look paste them and applaud the creativity and application of science fiction that isn't so far in the future that it is a guess. Much of the technology used in the shows is in some stage of development (not all, most) making the future feel like next generation. The highlight is in how from a social and psychological standpoint close it is to where we are today. The general sense is a bit of twilight zone mixed with next generation technology mixed with possible evolution of social or application of the tech from a darker perspective. Taking this next generation technology and exploring what hackers could do with it, how it could be used/misused by those in power, and other variations on this theme. The one thing I found in common was that how many times I had no intention of watching an entire episode only to watch it, and the next, and the next. Quite Addicting and well thought out with hopes that Netflix (which from what I can tell has taken it over) has done to improve it and increase the episodes. Hoping the upward trend continues and the creativity not lost. One of the best shows I've accidentally watched.\n",
            "I do not use to write reviews, but this series is gold and a must-watch for everyone who hasn't watched this yet. It's a mix of sci-fi, black comedy and drama. It might be a sci-fi, with the majority of the episodes being sci-fi(except one or two), but you gonna enjoy it regardless. Every episode is self-contained, so you can start from season 4 if you wish to but make yourself a favor and watch it lol.\n",
            "I can name you many reasons to watch it, but one of my favorite reasons is that \"disturbed\" feeling that you get every time an episode ends!\n",
            "This is the first time I have watched this series and although the episodes can be a bit depressing they are absolutely great episodes, such a good series, they've really put thought into the episodes and not to mention that you can watch them in any order you want! I think now that I have watched this new series I have to go and watch the rest and I have no doubt in my mind that the older episodes will just be as good. I feel like whoever created this series just though about the series and the episodes with thought, not a lazy made series at all there are too many out there like that where they rubbish.\n",
            "First, you can't just come here and review/rate everything but one season. This is all quite immature. It's like most of you are throwing a tantrum because the show didn't come back exactly how you like it and need it to be.The entire show is awesome. Yes, the first seasons are better, but i think season 5 is good, and a lot of 6. I love the Red Mirror episode.The disappointing thing is, a lot of you are only upset because of it not following some weird projected formula you came up with for it... As if it has to be that, or it's not Black Mirror. Shows change all the time, and do new things, different things. At it's heart, the show was still very much Black Mirror. It's even more sad because we could have had a new show from them... But everyone got upset that it wasn't the same, instead of just trying to watch it. I would have personally loved Red Mirror...I agree that Netflix ruins most things they touch, but you dont really know what you are talking about here. And talking about netfliz prices in a review? Bananas.I hope they come back to the Red Mirror idea again some day, and someone is willing to let them do it. Unfortunately everyone killed it...\n",
            "I've only just seen the first episode (National Anthem) and I am absolutely impressed!!! I've seen some negative reviews citing how the show is disturbing but that is quite literally the entire point of why I liked it. It would be like criticizing a roller coaster because it felt dangerous. Well, in my case, that would be a damn good reason why I'd LOVE a particular roller coaster.I guess I have the ability to separate fictional strife (this show, roller coasters, scary movies) from real strife (which I don't like at all). Aside from the story itself, I was impressed with the \"realism\" in portraying something that is in a slightly bizarro world version of ours. I guess I can imagine how Hollywood would screw this up with \"over-the-topness\". The British production values are at their best here.\n",
            "We are faced with an incredibly creative anthology of 18 different stories ranging from an immense variety of animation designs, cinematography, music-sound use, and transhumanism to cyber punk, from robotics to artificial intelligence, from the life of others to anti-militarism: Love, Death & Robots.It was obvious from the trailer that we would be watching interesting things, but I didn't expect that much. The taste of each episode remained in my palate. Death, Love & Robots show the end point of the animation. Cyberpunk, love, death, technology, apocalyptic, a variety of topics such as space is told. So each viewer can find something in the series. There were criticisms of sexism and violence, but I didn't encounter such a problem. Episode lengths range from six to seventeen minutes. Although it is a little short, you can understand the quality when you watch. 9/10\n",
            "Never saw the trailer. Just saw it while browsing netflix, didn't knew what to expect. But the first episode just blew my mind. So awesome. It was like watching watching a video game. The episodes are small but so good. No nonsense. Superb !!!\n",
            "What a unique production! Netflix definitely got something (very) right here. In fact, I wish there would be more quality content like this.Every single episode is intriguing and spectacular; it can be very violent at times, funny and sad. The art is just breathtaking. Writing is on point.So far I liked \"Sonnie's Edge\", \"The Witness\" and \"Beyond the Aquila Rift, \"Good Hunting\" and \"Zima Blue\" the best. More, please, Netflix!\n",
            "Sublimely animated (NSFW) shorts... each with it's own unique and beautiful (& mature) story. Think game cinematic-Animatrix saga with hyper-realistic futurism/multi-dimensional concepts. Absolutely GORGEOUS. I enjoyed each immensely, and cannot wait to see more, hopefully becoming a mainstream format.\n",
            "Honestly it just appeared on Netflix so I thought why not give it a try? and I am so happy I did. Every episode is so beautifully animated and the stories keep you interested from beginning to end! The most impressive and immersive thing Netflix has done in a little while, you aren't wasting you're time. believe me.\n",
            "I seriously hope Netflix produces more shows of this quality.\n",
            "Great animation quality together with themes and stories for adults are pretty much non existent. Until now.\n",
            "This is really worth getting a subscription for. At lest for me it was.\n",
            "Watched the complete series in one go!!! Could not stop watching!\n",
            "I am in awe of how truly great this is.On every level it impresses...Visuals, audio, script, acting, dialogue, atmosphere... It's got them all in spades!Just sit back and let the episodes draw you into their worlds.It is a work of art and should be celebrated.\n",
            "Black Mirror animation.At least as successful as \"Black Mirror\", interesting and very beautiful series. I started on the advice of a friend and I loved it, and you will too.\n",
            "Spectacular audio and animation violent,sad,funny good stories.Netflix did a good job,did something that most people do not expept to see.I want more content like that please Netflix.\n",
            "Season 1 was very good, with 2 really top quality stories.Season 2 was a somewhat a disappointment.Season 3 was totally WOW with an oscar worthy animated story at the end, as well as 2 other top quality episodes. Just 1 episode was average.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots is an anthology of animated science-fiction shorts. A few stories use live actors but heavy use of animation in the whole. Most of the animation is CG-- some might be hand-drawn or might be really well stylized CG, I'm not sure.The animation itself is stunning. This is next-gen. There are a wide variety of styles on display, but it's all great, as good as anything I've ever seen, and that's including the old masters. I mess about with 3D modelling, and the CG stuff is really breathtaking in the detail and in the bridge between style and realism. These are people who know their art.The stories themselves are very, very similar to those that you'd find in the old days in Heavy Metal-- the movie or the magazine. That means gratuitous sex, gratuitous violence; it means a certain aesthetic, focused on science-fiction-cool; it means cleverness, occasional humor, and plenty of weirdness. I wouldn't have expected good stories from a movie like this, yet LDR mostly delivers on that front: its narratives are well paced and enjoyable.Maybe its main weakness-- assuming gratuitous sex and violence doesn't turn you off- is its character writing. The characters may be modelled and animated nearly perfectly, but as characters they're still pretty two-dimensional. But I'm not sure how much anyone could expect from an anthology series on this front, and poor characterization is pretty much the rule in this genre.If you're a fan of science fiction or animation, and the sex and violence doesn't turn you off-- really, it's just there for its own sake, although some of us think that's fine-- then I think LDR will blow you away.\n",
            "The first season is just amazing but the second season? Meh.\n",
            "Speechless! Imagine there was no Vol. 2. Like it doesnt exist. Vol. 3 is stunningly beautiful, mind bending, and simply amazing. Congrats on a job well done to everyone that had a part in making LD+R Vol. 3. Wow!\n",
            "1st season was great. Lots of love, death and robots.. 2nd season... meh.\n",
            "Season 1 has its ups and downs but it holds a very decent level.Season 2 is less than half as long and much less than half as entertaining. Most stories are painfully, painfully generic. Only the animation remains. No need to explain more.8.5 S1.5 S2.\n",
            "After a very strong first season that I'd give 8 or 9 stars, came a much more dissapointing second season. The first season explores several sci-fi scenario's and other strange concepts and reminds me a bit of black mirror. The second season explores a few concepts that seem to barely answer the question that they start on. Animation is still strong though.\n",
            "I must say that I was totally blown away by these short animations, the story's brought out the best in what surrealism has to offer to the screen . What I particularly liked is that they were short stories , some were funny some not so funny, and really quite a mix bag of different things.I sometimes wonder whats going on with in story tellers heads when they come up with this surreal fantasy stuff.The animations and cartoon animations are mostly intended for an adult audience, with.a blend of humour chucked in the mix at the same time.Not sure sure who thinks this stuff up but it's definitely worth the watch, particularly if you want to watch something that's easey listening and viewing, you won't be disappointed.\n",
            "I say pick any episode of any season just for trying out and you won't be disappointed and all it would take is 10 minutes of your valuable time and give you a mind bending experience in return. Not a bad deal I would say.It is a treat for all the fans of sci-fi animation be it space adventure, zombie apocalypse, human Vs robot, genetic engineering, etc.Go for it without any second thought!\n",
            "Keeping things to the point:\n",
            "Yes season 1 had more episodes, with excellence amongst them, but season 2 still retains the charm, wonder and fantastic craft of these story writers and those that animate their ideas.Anyone disappointed with S2, (many have voiced that here on IMDb) that's a pity. The only thing that disappoints me with S2 is the fewer episodes, as I can't help but get through the episodes with some pace!Not wanting to sound condescending to other more negative reviewers (they can express as they please) but I take the view that I would like to see more of this...more Love Death & Robots. That is more likely to happen if we will it.To potential viewers, go ahead and watch, and do not be dissuaded by the negative reviews...particularly that of S2. It's all great if you keep and open mind and go with the flow.\n",
            "Anyone who grew up in the 90's should remember liquid Television. It gave us the original Aeon Flux and the first real HD animation. This is very reminiscent. The animation is great and even when it is not, it still fits the style. It should also be said that MTV Liquid Television was rated TV-14, this is very much deserving of its TV-MA rating.\n",
            "10 out of 10 just for Jibaro.The magic dance of Siren, the costumes, accessories were absolutely perfection, hard to imagine it's an animation.Would like to see longer movie versions.\n",
            "Initially, the series consists of 18 episodes that will pass with you very quickly. The show created by David Fincher does not disappoint expectations but is lost in a lot of unnecessary nudity in some episodes although it makes sense to show the style of painting.\n",
            "For each episode it has a specific graphic style which is amazing and the music is another matter. .\n",
            "There are some weak episodes in the series that are five episodes, but without that, the rest of the episodes are great\n",
            "My rating 8.4\n",
            "Not every episode is a masterpiece but they are all beautiful. It's like SciFi heaven. I want to shake Netflix's hand for putting this together. I haven't enjoyed this type of thing since the Animatrix. It's just wonderful. I can't tell you my favs. I'd have to rewatch them all a few time to separate the good from the brilliant.\n",
            "Please encourage more of this!\n",
            "This show is absolutely bonkers with violence, explicit scenes, and episodes. From minds of Tim Miller and David Fincher made a show with great animation of a mix with Twilight Zone and Black Mirror story telling. Buckle up for a wild ride!\n",
            "... that trippy storyline in \"The very Pulse of the Machine\". That mayhem in \"Jibaro\"...All episodes in a different style yet all insanely well done. I can't even say which I liked best; if it's not the art, then it's the compelling story.Can I have some mo'?\n",
            "First of all, just to get it out of the way. The animation in essentially every episode is phenomenal. It's easy to let the diverse visual spectacle sweep you up. With that said, story is really the key element, and while the first season ranges well through hard-hitting emotion, thrills, horror, and comedy with masterfully executed differences in pacing from tale to tale, the second season lacks in both of these categories. You just don't have enough time to develop any real connection to comedy or tragedy or intensity, and I think that's a testament to how much difference 8 minutes can make in a story. Even more to the point, the 1st season was a solid 18 episodes while the 2nd season doesn't even meet half that at 8 which just isn't enough for the short story style. Overall, I do like the show, but if their next set of entries is as lackluster and short as the 2nd season, I can see the show losing its darling status among viewers.\n",
            "The big difference between S1 and S2 of Love Death + Robots is the amount of episodes. I was a little disappointed when finding there was only 8 instead of the 18 we got in S1 and I think that's why most people are not as pleased and since they aren't as pleased, they are most probably finding the negativity in the episodes and connecting it to the negative feelings they have with the lack of episodes. There for creating a negative experience.But seriously the 8 episodes in S2 are great.All of them are great little stories and sometimes that's all we need, is a snippet into a characters life. And yes that snippet may only go for 5 to 10 minutes. But LD+R isn't about 30-60 minute stories with long drawn out sequences that are just there for filling time.It's actually quite impressive what these directors and writers can make you see and feel within a short period of time.This series is about short creative stories, with impressive and different animations about love, death and robots. S2 is no different to S1.\n",
            "Just Watch It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "The first episode had me hooked! Was like watching an amazing story line in a game! I wish there was a movie done on it, that's how much I loved it! Animation is incredible, on episode two and I am laughing my head off. Hitting each genre perfectly. 100% recommend!\n",
            "Great short stories with top notch animation\n",
            "You should give it a try its worth watching yeah I know some episodes are okaish but as I said before many great episodes delivering some message with a unique style of animation in each episode its intriguing and insanity hooks from 1st to last.\n",
            "Absolutely loved this show. I don't normally watch much animation and this is Quibi style so short, 5 minutes episodes (roughly). I have liked most of the Quibi series so I was used to this style so didn't bother me too much.The story and messaging has to get out there pretty quickly and this show was brilliant so I binged watched a lot of it. Each episode is unique and just soooo clever. A few of the stories were relevant to modern day which I loved and also centred around basic human behaviour.My favourite episode is 'Sonnie's Edge', which is the first episode of Season 1, I cannot say enough about this episode and have watched it many times. In fact I want to watch all seasons again.Initially the series reminded me of 'Black Mirror' but it is sharper and more intelligent. Love, Death and Robots just grabs your attention you won't want to stop pressing play for the next one.Excellent story lines and animation, can't wait for the next season, AAA+++ from me.\n",
            "Each story is calculated and created with uncommon creator attention. When the best creators get together, they can even express themselves like this! Subarashi.\n",
            "First of all, I must state that the animation in all episodes was extraordinary. I don't have any experience in creating animation but as a keen viewer of many animated films and shows, I was quite satisfied with the quality of it as much as the first volume. I think the major issue with the new volume is that it fails to be the anthology series it promises to be, the content is good, but the motives and world-building are repetitive and too limited to be an anthology, especially compared to its previous volume. I know by definition, it still qualifies as an anthology, but a pretty narrow one in my opinion. Below are the three repeating motives I've categorized:\"Automated Customer Service\" & \"Life Hunch\"\n",
            "Two episodes on malfunctioning robots - We all love the \"robot goes rogue and screws things up for those around it\" storyline, but seeing it twice in an anthology with only eight chapters felt quite repetitive. Even though the episodes were different from each other in various aspects, (animation, setting, characters) their plots were both revolving around a character trying to survive against a malfunctioning robot that was designed to help them but was operating in the completely opposite way. Also, having only 1/4 of the show tell stories with robots while the show's title is 1/3 robots is a bit off-putting.\"Ice\", \"Pop Squad\" & \"Snow in the Desert\"\n",
            "Three episodes on enhanced individuals and their relationship with those outcasts in the system - They were all different in their world-building and \"Ice\" focused on the one ousted individual in the system, \"Pop Squad\" did a similar thing for a few enjoyable instances, which were both good choices I think. The \"Snow in the Desert\" and \"Ice\" were somewhat similar in the way their universes felt like, futuristic societies with enhanced individuals in a scenario where we stretched too far in the galaxy and people are after bizarre things that might get them killed. Two of my favourite episodes are in this category, namely those that aren't \"Ice\". \"Ice\" wasn't awful, but it was very anticlimactic, I believe it means to illustrate an example of injustice within the given system, however hard you try in a society with enhanced individuals as a non-enhanced, you will still be an outcast even when you are successful. Alright, fair point, injustice occurs in all societies and often they are similarly absurd, but just showing the sheer exclusion of a person from beginning to end without giving a kernel of idea as to what change could occur in this society is unfair to the viewer who is spending their time and money to watch this, it's not that I expect a catharsis at the end of anything I watch, but this one was just so disappointingly hopeless and hollow.\"The Tall Grass\", \"All Through the House\" & \"The Drowned Giant\"\n",
            "Three episodes on weird, unknown, creepy creature(s) - I think \"The Drowned Giant\" episode was unique on its own, I'll come back to that. But first, these three were the only ones that didn't take place in a futuristic or dystopian setting. I'll admit, I expect this show to present prospective instances of the far or near future, but one of my favourite episodes from the previous chapter took place in the post-war USSR, so I always have high expectations for the contemporary content in the series as well. \"The Tall Grass\" and \"All Through the House\" did not fully meet my expectations, but they were unique in their own way and were enjoyable to watch, although I still find it repetitive to have two similarly constructed episodes, around the mystery of a dangerous creature that they survive due to a metaphorical(being good) or a direct(the conductor) deus ex machina, as I said, this is a general shortcoming for this entire volume. Speaking for myself, \"The Drowned Giant\" was the most interesting episode in this volume, it wasn't my favourite, but it was different from all the others, it did include a giant, which does fit the unknown, weird creature description, but it was never about the giant itself, it was the idea that the giant represented for the narrator/scientist character and what it represented to the rest of the people in their society. It was the elephant in the room, society was triumphant over it, over their fear of the idea of a colossal monster, whilst the narrator was simply curious, wistful. It was the undeserved victory of a collective mind and the personal desire to understand the unknown. In the end, it was just a memory, both for the narrator and the people, we watched the creation of a larger-than-life memory, a myth, a story from the older times.This is all the rambling from me folks, I realize I spent more time on some episodes than the others, please approach this as nothing more than a random guy's random opinions on something he could never create himself. Cheers.\n",
            "I have not seen something beautiful ever with nostalgic animation work.Thank you Netflix for this and all the super creative creators.Watched all three seasons and waiting for another season.\n",
            "And had a child. This series is fantastic. If you are too young, go back and watch Heavy Metal from 1981. Way ahead of it's time. This reminds me a lot of that.\n",
            "I love anthologies, and I love animation... So the two together is a real treat. Especially when the animation and story lines are so brilliant and emotional. WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU WON'T REGRET A SECOND!\n",
            "Animation, direction, story and every minute of each episode is Brilliant.\n",
            "Despite most of the episodes are CGI and/or animation, this is not a series for children. 18+ only.And considering each episodes are only approximately 30 mins long, each episode's production value are extremely high. I'm talking big budget movie blockbuster quality high. I found most of the storyline, original and immensely imaginative - not to mention extremely varied.VERDICT: Surprisingly an uber good series. The only con is, there isn't enough episodes per season.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots makes a clear statment once again that time only encapsulates what it can show.With how each of the episode is formatted, some of the episodes have 8-15 minutes to express themselves. That is what makes LD&R great, due to the small time frame, it crams in its theme right up to the core of its stories.Now, its up to the audience to try an comprehend the purpose of the episodes, whether it is clear or unclear. This shows just keeps people coming back for more once you're hooked!By far my favorite is from SS3 episode 2, \"Bad Traveling\", its able to pull off a cinematic and thrilling story worth over an hour of content within 15 minutes.\n",
            "Brilliant - loved the first season and loving the second. Hope there's going to be a third.\n",
            "Watching this anthology of shorts, some of which are very short indeed, feels a lot like reading an old Heavy Metal magazine. As a teenager, I used to devour these collections of science fiction, fantasy and horror stories that usually featured sex and nudity and frequently violence and gore, sometimes both on the same page.Netflix essentially created an animated version of these pulpy, yet often beautifully illustrated comic books. L, D & R is just as hit-and-miss, just as violent and sexually titillating (for a straight male audience, that is), and, every once in a while, just as artistically beautiful. I just wish it had something to say, or at least a few compelling stories to tell. It all felt a bit shallow and very derivative underneath the flashy exterior. I'm afraid sci-fi fans looking for truly original ideas will be rather disappointed.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots was originally going to be a feature length reboot of Heavy Metal; it's pretty damn stupefying knowing the path they ultimately decided to go with: an animated series of self-contained stories on Netflix where there are no true restraints on the contents of the stories or visuals. These stories are perfect trips for video game fans, sci-fi fans (like myself) and even comic book fans who just can't get enough of their far-and-wide alternate universes in fiction.Netflix is truly raising the bar for mainstream filmmaking, and this series shows that it doesn't conform to nostalgia-driven things like 'Stranger Things' all the time, but that even in an age where people love familiarity with their stories there is still a desire to see something new, inspiring and insightful. Love, Death & Robots is exactly that kind of ecstasy; it's an experimental trip that's both familiar yet satisfyingly new and bold. I'd say that my favorites would have to be 'Alternate Histories', 'Good Hunting', 'Sucker of Souls' and 'The Witness'. To be fair though, ALL the episodes are pretty good. They each cover their own respective genres just nicely.If you want to check out Love, Death & Robots but haven't gotten around to doing so because you're still yet to make up your mind, do yourself a favor and watch this pronto. It's a Netflix-Must!This Netflix-Must gets 4.5/5 stars.\n",
            "Season 1 was almost perfect, season 2 was shorter and had only a few great episodes. But season 3 is well as short as season 2, but every single episode is as good as the best episodes of season 1. I still would want for longer seasons but if i had to choose quality or quantity i'd want quality.Good job on everyone working on this incredible show.\n",
            "I love all the Devilman Crybaby vibes I get from this show!!! It's disturbingly gruesome at times and laugh out loud funny at others. I haven't even watched the entire season but I'm already looking forward to season 2! If you loved Devilman Crybaby or Black Mirror, you'll love this show. If you aren't sure about it, just give it a try because it's honestly so good!!!\n",
            "I had no idea what to expect going into this, but was not disappointed. The first episode is amazing and I truely wish the show was based on that. However, it's a bunch of unrelated shorts which are all good in their own sense and this is a great show you can just throw on at any time because the episodes are all unrelated. I feel this will be like the old Nickelodeon series where they figure out which episode is most popular and make a series off of it. Atleast I hope that's the case because episode one was unbelievable\n",
            "I wish Netflix made more of such content than all of the nitty bitty unwatchable stuff. This show is AMAZING!!I still remember watching the 1st season back in 2019, and having my mind blown by the different styles of animation and the strong impact the stories had even tho being so short.\n",
            "Season 3 did not disappoint. The animation in some of the stories is so lifelike. Especially, Jibaro!\"Night of the Mini Dead\" is hilarious. And I liked the ideas portrayed in \"Bad Traveling\" and \"In Vaulted Halls Entombed.\"\n",
            "Love Death & Robots seems to have become a benchmark for animation. Jibaro went beyond all my expectations. The dancelike movements, intricate details of the location, and the soundtrack all made it a great watch.Can't wait for the next season.\n",
            "To make this clear I don't like watching animated films or shows I'm not a child anymore, I was flicking through netflix this morning and came across love death and robots I watched the trailer and thought this looks good but it's animated what shall I do ignore it or give it a go if I don't like it I can just stop watching it so I just give it a go so I started to watch it WOW this netflix series is brilliant I can't stop watching it I could watch this all day everyday and still not get bored of it. Because I'm not into animated films or shows I like the shortness of each episode plus it's not made for kids it's an 18 or should be with the swearing, nudity, blood and violence in each episode. It's well written and the animation in some episodes are so excellent they almost seem so real I know they are but from an animation perspective..... It's brilliant what else can I say just keep up the great work and please have many episodes to come thankyou for your great work it's been a great watch thankyou. Anybody who isn't into animation like me just give it a go it's a must watch.\n",
            "I was blown away by this series, having accidentally stumbled upon it. All I can remember is thinking every second that it's so good it can't be real, can it? Must watch.\n",
            "It's a masterpiece. I can't even. I just finished watching and am overwhelmed. It looks amazing, stories are deep and exciting, art and animation are ridiculously good and diverse and you can see more character definition and development in 5 min than other 2 hrs movies can handle. For god's sake I cannot believe I just randomly clicked on this when was bored. There is so much raw energy, creativity and madness in this show. I absolutely friggin love it and grateful to whoever did this.\n",
            "It's impossible to summarise this series as each story is unique. Suffice to say it's a gem. \"Jibaro\", the last episode of series 3, is magnificent - a work of art and totally unforgettable. If you don't watch this you're missing something unmissable.\n",
            "Every story is unique set with it's own beautiful animation that helps tells it's story.\n",
            "It feels as if Netflix chose individual, talented, minor artists and gave them a chance to shine.\n",
            "No story is the same and neither is the animation style.\n",
            "Cannot recommend this enough, you must watch it all at least once!\n",
            "Some episodes are good, some are ok, and some are very bad. Don't understand the hype this show is getting. It's ok but definitely not a masterpiece as some reviews say. The animations are extremely good but the stories not so. But its watchable you can give it a try\n",
            "What I like about this show is it is totally outside the box!!Amazing plots and endings\n",
            "In my opinion it's best sci-fi series!!Loved the 3 seasons so far and i have to comment on the amazing graphics and animation 👍👍👍\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots is a visually stunning anthology series created by Netflix to showcase different types of animation and the different stories that can be told through them. The first 3 seasons are ambitious in a way that pushes the technology the animators are suing to the absolute limit. All the episodes (approx. 20 minutes long) are very different in animation style, but a very unique in how they use the animation to tell a story that can only be told using animation. Some of the episodes are very bloody and gory, creating a very cerebral experience for the audience. I would recommend this show to someone who appreciates the hard work behind animation, or a brave soul who is looking for something to expand their mind of film.\n",
            "Perfect execution of short stories. Would not advise binging it. But definitely watch it with a break, even if the short run period of each story will tempt to binge.Suggesting a break cos it covers a crazy range of topics, genres...can't even classify. But every single episode has a story, and a damn good story at that. And with a run time of 10-20 minutes, it has been incredibly done.The only comparison I can think of is Black Mirror...superb stories, characters and production all across. It gets even better with LD&B. The details for backgrounds, stage settings for each scene, angle of direction, lightings, art style, and of course the character details are on a level for 15 minute shorts.This is an epitome of an anthology for short stories, with each having their individual animation/graphic style. And that's actually a damn good thing. Unlike the superb 2000s Animatrix, here each episode is a completely different story with no constraints of relating to a larger picture.Started season 3 after forgetting this series and on episode 2 now. Had to give a shoutout before continuing. Unsure if it was a good thing that I'd forgotten about it or not.PS. Edited last couple of paragraphs after watching S3E1.\n",
            "Overall an entertaining, visually fascinating anthology. Some really amazing action scenes, characters, and stories. The unique animation styles alone makes it worth checking out. Character development is not a major issue, they do a good job there with what little time each episode has. Most episodes do a good job with plot.Unfortunately, the series does contain biased political messages, amateur writing/dialogue, and \"forced\" adult material. For some moments, it seemed like the creators relied solely on sex and violence to distract the viewers from how sub-par everything else was about the episode. In other words, the \"adult\" content was a hit and miss.One thing for sure, each episode is completely different; animation styles, themes, stories, characters, plots, emotions, are never replicated. Really the only element all episodes share, is the genre of Science Fiction. It's a fantastic start to an animated anthology series, and let's hope that not only we get more seasons after this, but it continues to get better, as there is room for improvement.Episodic review:1st episode (Sonnie's Edge): Amazing animation, cool creatures, a sweet creature fight, engaging story with an awesome ending. Heavy misandristic/feminism vibes, however. Aside from that, one can tell a lot of heart, thought, and work went into this short. Good one to start the season, and the series with. 8/10\n",
            "Main genres/tone: Sci-Fi/Action/Drama, serious\n",
            "Mature content: violence, blood/gore, profanity, and nudity.2nd episode (Three Robots): Way too political to enjoy. Anti-theistic, anti-human, there were some good jokes and funny moments, but some flat ones too. Would be a good episode, if it weren't for all the subtle/unsubtle far-left messages and forgettable jokes. 3/10\n",
            "Main genres/tone: Sci-Fi/Comedy, humorous\n",
            "Mature content: profanity3rd episode (The Witness): Reminds me of an ultra-violent eye-rape anime called \"Dead Leaves,\" only with a serious tone instead of a humorous one. Plot is engaging at first with good potential, but ends up being too stylized, confusing and conceited, with over-the-top nudity. Even the flashy, exotic animation couldn't save this one. Fun visuals, pass on almost everything else. 4/10\n",
            "Main genres/tones: Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller, upbeat & serious\n",
            "Mature content: violence, blood, profanity, and nudity.4th episode (Suits): Weak writing, and the animation comes off as \"rushed.\" Still, a likable episode. Love the Half-Life 2 crab-like creatures. 6.5/10\n",
            "Main genres/tones: Sci-Fi/Action, lightly serious with bits of humor\n",
            "Mature content: violence, blood, profanity5th episode (Sucker of Souls): The animation style seems to be a tribute to violent 90's anime. Cool story, witty well-placed humor, with twisted horror elements makes this one so far one of the best, especially for horror fans. Especially enjoyed the new spin on an old, familiar horror villain icon, and the element of kitties. Makes up for the trite, cats-are-evil concept that a certain earlier episode embraced. Only complaints are with the ending: not much resolve, and it reveals a plot hole or two. 8.5/10\n",
            "Main genres/tones: Sci-Fi/Horror/Action/Comedy/Fantasy, balanced mix of horror & comedy\n",
            "Mature content: heavy violence, blood/gore, profanity, light nudity.6th Episode (When The Yogurt Took Over): This narrated short has animation similar to Pixar, starts off interesting enough, but just ends on a question mark. With more time to establish a structured plot, it may be a sufficient enough ending, but this one just leaves audiences scratching their heads. A bit humorous and silly, mostly just bland. 5/10\n",
            "Main genres/tones: Sci-Fi/Comedy/Drama, comedy & potential satire\n",
            "Mature content: some cartoony nudity & brief violence7th episode (Beyond the Aquila Rift): One of the most impressive and realistic animation styles, it's a lot like a lot of popular sci-fi mind-bending thrillers all shoved into a few minutes. Keeps audiences guessing until the end...a very creepy, unsettling, gnarly end. It's like if the characters in the game series \"Mass Effect\" had an \"oopsie\" during a mass relay. Super cool short. 9/10\n",
            "Main genres/tones: Sci-Fi/Drama/Thriller, serious\n",
            "Mature Content: Light violence, moderate language, nudity & sex, some disturbing imagery8th episode (Good Hunting): With an animation style very similar to \"The Iron Giant,\" this episode dives into Japanese mythology, while mixing together the industrial revolution and robotics, with a sort of steam-punk feel. This gets my vote as saddest episode, as the story between the son of a spirit hunter forms a bond with a shapeshifting magical girl. It's a story of loss, protection, revenge, love, and coping with change. Wonderfully animated, emotional tale. Yet again though, almost ruined by unnecessary and distracting nudity. 8/10\n",
            "Main genres/tones: Sci-Fi/Drama/Fantasy, serious\n",

            "I find myself amazed at the variety of deep and engaging storylines that left me at the edge of my seat... Enraptured, in awe, perplexed, in love, angry and even clamoring for more.This anthology is unique in its offering and I can't wait for the second volume. Nearly all of the visual novellas are masterpieces in their own right both in story and in animation style.\n",
            "Beautiful .\n",
            "To be honest I was skeptical about it at first. , but immediately fell in love with the unique story's , and the ability to make me attached to each character in 15 min , as if I know them for 10 seasons . I teared laughed bit my fingernails energized by the action,U Pushed all my buttons\n",
            "brilliant work thank you.\n",
            "From a stimulating, exciting, brain-tickling, subverting expectations in the best way possible adult show in vol. 1 to a very mediocre (expect for one or two episodes,) mostly style over substance vol. 2. If you're considering to renew your Netflix subscription just watch vol. 2, I'd suggest to wait for something more worth your money, and to watch vol. 2 as a background series then. But if you haven't seen vol. 1, watching vol. 2 first (or episodes from both volumes at random) might end up being a good experience overall.\n",
            "Season one was brilliant, a game changer. Season two had its amazing moments but also its flaws. Season three, however, manages to have you sit in front of the screen again - awestruck and amazed by the storytelling, emotions, and editing/sound.\n",
            "This takes me back when I was a kid when I would get Heavy Metal magazines, the art work and the stories would transport me to that world. Then Heavy Metal the movie came out and just blew my mind. I love the short story format and the graphics are just amazing.Two thumbs up 👍👍.I hope it continues.\n",
            "OF course, since there are many shorts to choose from, one can say the \"lesser are brought up by the better.\"\n",
            "However, each has it's own appeal and are very well done.\n",
            "Watch it, not once but several times.\n",
            "Well done.\n",
            "Definitely worth a watch. Allthough not every episode is really that \"good\". I would recommend to check the different episodes ranking on imbd. There arent many bad episodes but you could save some time skipping 2,3 pointless entries. My personal favs are helping hand and good hunting!\n",
            "This is getting amazingly awesome by the minute,\n",
            "Can't wait for volume four.Exceptional detailed concept, demandes looking into the deeper layers of each episode.\n",
            "It is good for sure, a little strange but the concept and the changing of stories reminds me of the classic Animatrix which came out after the first Matrix.\n",
            "Something else that needs to go onto Netflix if this is popular\n",
            "As with most things in life, to each their own. Nonetheless I felt a bit compelled to provide a slightly different point of view from the stream of 10's I'm seeing on IMDb so far.I see a lot of \"now this is Art!\" comments. To be clear, film (even when shown on television) has been recognized as Art for generations now. Granted, this particular series is generally well executed and presents visuals that are often stunning and unique - but let's not trip over ourselves trying to hold up Love, Death & Robots as some breakthrough for the medium. And as gorgeous as it is, it's not without some really obvious flaws. The uncanny valley is still very deep with this series.In terms of substance, this was nothing short of painful to watch. Completely predictable plot, utterly shallow dialogue, heavy handed cliches and extremely clumsy in its execution. The \"twists\" could be seen a mile away, and then any subsequent counter-twist felt tacked on as \"gotchas\" even though they were often transparent themselves. And the jokes suffered the exact same fate. Everything about the script felt like a first draft attempt.There was also a strangely tone-deaf nature to much of the subject matter as well. The series sets up strong themes of empowerment, diversity and responsibility, only to explore those themes through extremely childish, macho narrative devices and stereotypes. It's an adolescent boy's attempt at writing about deeper issues without any greater understanding of them. Highly (and needlessly) sexualized (women only), brutally violent (because violence = power of course), and unimaginatively crass and crude (because curse words are \"brutal, and \"real\"). I've seen some reviews actually decrying the themes as \"SJW\" - but interestingly, I think if you look even a tiny bit below the surface, it's more likely the opposite.Yes, I've never seen anything quite like Love, Death & Robots before, but I still find it empty all the same. Plenty to see, nothing to take away.\n",
            "Season 2 is really good. But season 1 was much more intense and thrilling. The makers can carry this on for as long as possible since it's not a storyline concerned show. Make it at least 20.\n",
            "Best visual, best stories, best in everything i don't have any words to described it.\n",
            "Who knew animation could be so compelling.Many of these \"worlds\" should be augmented and explored either as film features or as a series.Damn there are some inventive minds in this field.More animation please Netflix.\n",
            "Just finished watching the previous seasons.This is basically what you get when you give creative freedom to a bunch of writers/actors and a 💰 full of money.For those who are still missing out on this gem. Watch it for the wow factor and thought-provoking scenarios.Beware of extreme violence and nudity tho, it's Netflix after all.\n",
            "Very engaging with unexpected content.Animation is no match with any recent features.\n",
            "Love, Death + Robots delivers an inspired collection of short animated films that present a combination of intriguing concepts, unusual animation styles and strong voice acting, resulting in an eclectic mix of twisted tales.\n",
            "I want second season of this show best show legendary animation\n",
            "I always watch this, I like the format and the creativity but I wish they would spend less time on the looks and more on the stories. All episodes look perfect, 2D or 3D, but the stories are weak and many are predictable and it becomes a nice gallery of animations with few things to tell. It's like looking at some nice NFT's :D.For the producers of these episodes I would say: a good story doesn't need so much work. People can easily ignore the lack of a good rendering or animated frames if the story is ok.\n",
            "My Review Will Be Short And Sweet...Season 1 Was incredible...Season 2 Was Almost Absolute Trash.\n",
            "Do any of you the favor to yourselves and watch this incredible show. Its a complete anthology of dark, beautiful, crazy sci-fi stories with extremely good animation and in my opinion script. I wanted the first epiode to continue and i was kinda dissapointed when i realised, the complete show is different stories, but in the end its better because you have a better experience after all.As other reviewers say, not a minute wasted with this show and dont listen to those who say, its a copy of black mirror. It may has some vibes, but thats all. its unique and the work they have done, its truly magestic. I didnt even notice when i reached the last episode. Press the play button already!\n",
            "This is easily one of the best things, if not the best thing, I've seen in a very long time. So witty, clever and intelligent. So entertaining and fun. Love it!\n",
            "This series has something for everyone. While not every episode \"tickles my fancy\" this series contains something for everyone. The stories are diverse, intriguing, exciting, beautiful. I can not recommend this enough to anyone that has at least the slightest interest to cinematography and storytelling. A true masterpiece.\n",
            "Theres such a big market for adult animation. Its so very seldomly well done , but this is one of the good ones. I love the quality of the animation , the twilight zone type stories. I hope they get longer, maybe a standard 15 minutes to 30! But i like the versatility. Its one of my favorite animated series now. I cant wait for more seasons filled with more episodes. Keep up the great work!Adult Animation ROCKS!\n",
            "The \"Jibaro\" episode deserves an Oscar! What a terrific story, an absolute gem and visually stunning.I wish they were thousands of episodes with stories like these. The imaginative level is superb and incomparable. Would recommend to everyone and rewatch it any day!\n",
            "I dont wanna compare which one was the best but i felt every episode was the best in its's own way . More eerie creepy some smiles and a sense of what will happen will there be a continuation will make you to watch the next episode expecting the same.. the animations are all well done nothing subpar and deserves all a big thumbs up.\n",
            "\"Love, Death & Robots\" is exactly what today's film industry needed. Unfortunately, nowadays you see very often that the same concept is produced over and over again and sold as \"new\". The series shows that things can be done differently if you put more work into a project than just a lunch break. The series is just finally something fresh and beautiful!Each episode presents a new story with a new animation style. Because of this, it's hard to get bored.Because of this each and everyone also has their favorite episodes and we get to experience something completely new with every episode.I hope netflix keeps this series alive for a long time!\n",
            "As someone that had heard of the show but it being a Netflix show with great 'critical acclaim', I, like I'm sure many, decided to give it a miss. Last night while bored I decided to give it a go and to be fair it isn't all bad!For one, the animation throughout the majority of the episodes is great! There are some not so great ones and others that look like you're being told what to do as a next mission on a Capcom game but generally really good and worthy of an 8 star.Sadly everything else is weaker.A few scripts in each season throughout the 3 so far were great, but, they were few and far between. Some of them felt like a 15 year old who had seen Black Mirror a few times writing something they think a 12 year old would like.Along with that a lot of the voice acting was beyond bad! I wouldn't even use 'called it in' because maybe if they had used a phone they may have sounded less wooden.Lastly as one who couldn't care less about nudity or swearing it was odd to me that Netflix would do so much in one show, almost as if they wanted some controversy to boost ratings..??Anyway, I diverge. The animation is mostly great, the stories are more miss than hit and the voice acting is generally not good but passable. Overall I think a 7/10 is a very fair.\n",
            "Credit must be given in all episodes to the animators - the levels of technical detail and stylised novelty is incredible in every instance, showing glimpses of future possibilities. The storylines themselves, as with anthologies, are hit and miss. Personal preference will play a large part (for instance, IMDB reviews of some episodes are far from what I think), but on the whole explore interesting concepts. Some are even genuinely forward thinking, emulating Black Mirror-esque storylines.Being only 5-15 minutes long, they are all easy watches; thus, even the unenjoyable ones are only short interludes. I would give this a watch purely out of curiosity - at least one of these sci-fi stories is bound to entertain.\n",

            "This is honestly some of the best content on Netflix. With each episode being a different short story, each one grips you more than most feature length TV shows streaming on Netflix at the moment. Great writing and stunning animation. Season 2 falls short of how good season 1 was, but still great nonetheless.\n",
            "This series explores complex, futuristic and themes, with beautiful, beautiful animation. Each episode is a unique and polished work of art and mini film in its own right. The episodes vary in lengths and styles of animation, some are more lighthearted and some are deep, disturbing and dystopian. It is one of my absolute favourites 😍 I would also say that if you love black mirror you'll likely love this.\n",
            "What is said in the title is the answer to the question if I were asked to briefly describe this collection of short films. From the first there is a penchant for conventionally acute social themes and exaggerated cruelty, and from the second a mixture of genres from science fiction to horror with the obligatory unexpected plot twist at the end.They say that the viewing sequence for different users may differ depending on certain parameters. I personally watched the collection on Netflix, I haven't tested this theory, maybe there is something underneath it, although fundamentally it doesn't affect anything. The videos are not connected to the plot in any way.It is worth noting that those who are especially impressionable and suspicious, as well as those who are not fans of modern short films, should immediately pass by most of the videos in the selection, since the level of \"anatomical\" cruelty, gore and other guts in the frame is relative (and more often without) in each second video subjectively repeats a number of fatalities from the latest parts of \"Mortal Kombat\" combined. Perhaps the presence of one of the authors of \"Deadpool\" is having an effect here, but it seems that this is the general tendency of the genre today, when it comes to modern short films from England or the USA - maximum bloody action, straightforward eroticism, and a pinch of semantic load.Everyone who is not too lazy has already gone over the general points, so to describe in a nutshell I will draw (where I can and I see the point) an analogy from the category if you liked it, then you can pay attention to the following in movies, games, less often somewhere else along the next gradation :+ - subjectively liked it.+/- \"watchable.\"\n",
            "? - strange.* nothing particularly interesting.(!) - an additional designation for the \"relatively\" context of \"not moderate\" volumes of blood and other \"obscenities\". In case anyone wants to bypass them.18:(!) + 1. Sonnie's Edge. CGI graphics. A typical sketch of the cyberpunk genre.* 2. Three Robots. A parable about eternal human shortcomings and idiosyncrasies in the interpretation of three robots that are not similar to each other. The closest statement on the topic is \"WALL-E\" (2008).(!) ? 3. The Witness. Again CGI, but with an emphasis on realism. I forgot the name of this technique... I'll leave it without comment. \"Memento\" (2000) by Christopher Nolan.+/- 4. Suits. No comments. If you're interested in big, walking mechs, then when it comes to games, \"MechCommander \"(1998-1999) and the \"BattleTech\" (2018) are worth a look.(!) - 5. Suckers of Souls. Anime. Lots of blood. The semantic load is level with the latest parts of \"Another World\" with Kate Beckinsale. If you like vampire themes, I recommend the very first part, which was released in 2003. As well as the classic RPG genre - \"Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines\" (2004). Or wait for the sequel.+/- 6. When the yogurt too... 3D animation. And another philosophical parable. Similar to 2.(!) + 7. Beyond the Aquila Rift. CGI in space with a twist at the end. CGI is of a level we probably won't see in games for years to come. But who knows. To play - \"Mass Effect 2\" and 3.+ 8. Good Hunting. Not a bad anime with a touch of steampunk and erotica. Google \"steamgirl\". If you're lucky, you'll end up on a site with a clear combination of the first and second.* 9. The Dump. 3D. \"District No. 9\" (2009).(!) - 10. Shape Shifters. CGI with an emphasis on realism about the heavy burden of werewolves in the war in Afghanistan.* 11. Helping Hand. A parable about self-sacrifice. \"Moon 2112\" (2009).? 12. Fish Night. Graphic style: \"Cel-shading\". See the entire \"Borderlands\" series from Gearbox.+/- 13. Lucky 13. Again space and battles in it. A parable about superstitions.+ 14. Zima Blue. An abstract meditative creation about the search for the meaning of life. \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\" (2010).+/- 15. Blindspot. An ordinary outing of \"shadow runners\" in a typical cyberpunk. See the \"Shadowrun\" trilogy of games.+/- 16. Ice Age. The only video with real actors + CGI. I'll leave it without any other comments.* 17. Alternative Histories. A \"what if?\" story. The drawing style is somewhat reminiscent of modern 2d flat, used here and there. Specifically in the context of the plot - the trilogy of \"Wolfenstein\" games, starting with \"The New Order\", \"The Man in the High Castle\".(!) * 18. The Secret War. CGI + mysticism. Play \"Singularity\" (2010).As for the rating, minus two points for the degree that is clearly on average too bent with the component of the formula according to the principle \"sea of blood and mountains of corpses\" == cool!. Not cool.And another minus point for the combination of this matter with the often lack of semantic load as an element as a whole. The pretentiousness of some conventionally art-house authors is annoying. In contrast, one way or another, we have already seen all of this to one degree or another in different, sometimes better, packaging. So, I got 4 out of 18 full pluses: \"Sonnie's Edge\", \"Beyond the Aquila Rift\", \"Good Hunting\", \"Zima Blue\".\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots is an animated series that showcases the power of storytelling in the modern era. It is not merely a narrative but an exploration of profound meanings related to daily life and the advancements of technology in today's world. Each episode in this series is unique, which is what makes it so captivating.One of the highlights that captivated me is the use of dark humor that allows us to laugh and feel unsettled simultaneously. Situations that may seem ordinary in everyday life turn into comedic and thought-provoking moments, all through exceptional production and beautiful animation. We can deeply understand the creative process and see the dedication of the team in every detail.In each episode, I felt a different emotional flavor, whether it was excitement, sadness, or even humor, making the viewing experience feel fresh and exhilarating every time. Furthermore, the sound design and audio techniques are remarkable, serving as an element that enhances the atmosphere and emotions in each episode seamlessly.The dialogue in this series is insightful and engaging, with storytelling that never feels tedious. Each episode offers distinct selling points but manages to connect them beautifully. The social and political satire, alongside technological commentary, prompts us to question the world we live in, making it clear that this series is a must-watch.Ultimately, I am excitedly awaiting the next season of Love, Death & Robots. It is not just an ordinary animated series but a bold piece of art filled with creativity that I believe everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime!\n",
            "This series is sublime, it provides everything you could ever want and imagine in Sci-fi! I've never been so moved... For me each episode was like walking through an art Gallery and viewing the greatest works of art.\n",
            "Bravo?\n",
            "Almost all episodes make you think further than the script like Black Mirror but with less limitation due to animation platform!Love it! And Recommend for those picky viewers like me!!!... 😁\n",
            "I love it, every episodes are unique and differents!\n",
            "What an amazing collection of short stories.Some should be whole series, some videos games, some movies.Each & everyone will keep you watching, no less.This is hands down, amazing.Animation, storytelling, just sit back for the ride.I promise you won't regret.\n",
            "Three words : Love , Death , Robots.\n",
            "Its a fresh new project that takes influence from various sci fi writers and directors.Season one had short stories with mind bending plot twists , brilliant characters and some crazy scenarios.For some of these , I couldn't even create them in my imagination before I watched them.\n",
            "Also , the animating is really alive , and great overall. Maybe not something you would show to your kid, but its appropriate teenagers.\n",
            "Waiting for season two...\n",
            "If you don't have time to watch this anthology then make some...Be truly amazed at the technology, story telling, types of animation , the ability to create something truly amazing. Each time one short passed by the next was equally remarkable, it's a true thrill ride giving the viewer a white knuckle ride on something never experienced within watchable content of animation. NETFLIX I tip my hat to you. WOW\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots is rather odd series consisting of random animated stories of no more than 20 minutes in length.However, odd though it may be the quirkiness and storylines vary so much that there is something to please everyone.The main thing I enjoyed was just how different the animation was with each new episode. The detail in some of them is incredible and it's clear a lot of time was put in getting them right.Overall, I enjoyed the series.7 out of 10.\n",
            "Sure the art is excellent, but people can create art without having to have so much violence, gore and sex with one or more wrapped into each episode. A couple of them were really great, but most are just violent, bloody messes, and even the good ones had it in them. I'm not expecting Mary Poppins, but was expecting a bit more intellectually and challenging subjects that had more than violence for the backbone of the show.\n",
            "A classic example of a roller coaster ride where you don't care much about the destination. But the journey, man oh man. See Snow in the desert\"\n",
            "This show is so fantastic thank you to all the creators and staff involved in making it because it really is an entertaining sci fi anthology story! I wish I could play so many of these episodes as video games because they build entire worlds in the span of 5-15 minutes. I do wish the episodes were longer and some of them might even get up to 25 min but they never feel long enough, but that is the point I suppose? There are so many animation styles, voices and actors that pop up that I truly think you can watch this with anyone who enjoys sci fi or fantasy stuff and give it a try, maybe under the influence? Haha cause it can be a bit trippy.\n",
            "If you like CGIs, animations and short stories this is a fabulous collection.\n",
            "The 3D animations are absolutely phenomenal.\n",
            "Some stories were not to my taste but the great art work made up for it.\n",
            "I had a blast watching it.\n",
            "So far 2 seasons in, this series provides stories and shorts for everyone! While there may be some I don't like, it's hard not to appreciate the high budget and great voice acting in every single short. All styles presented are well animated and there's a very good sense of passion. Typically with something like this where I may not like every short it may cap off at a 7 but I have yet to see a bad story, bad style or anything. This is a fantastic watch. Well done Netflix.\n",
            "So this anthology is entertaining for the most part. The episodes that are great are really fantastic. 10/10 for several (mainly the early ones). Most of the 18 are mediocre at best. Some are interesting, some boring and predictable. Several have incredible animation. I would say the fantastic ones are: Three Robots, the witness, beyond the Aquila rift, and sonnies edge. The terrible ones are the dump, sucker of souls, blindspot, alternate histories. The rest are somewhere in between. Worth it to watch the series, but nowhere near the ridiculous hype everyone seems to be talking about.\n",
            "Season 1 is a 10. Great ideas, animations, explorations of how the animations are given, styles, story, and the amount of content.Season 2 is a 8. Some great ideas, animations are solid, but not enough content. Maybe we were spoiled with season 1, but there should have been more episodes and ideas like season 1.\n",
            "I was recommended to watch \"Love, Death & Robots\" by one of my friends, so I decided to give it a chance, despite being initially deterred by it being an animated show.Well, it turns out that I would definitely have been missing out on something quite unique, bordering on being extraordinary, had I not decided to sit down and watch it. And I ended up binge watching all episodes of the first season in rapid succession. Yeah, it was actually that interesting.The stories, despite being relatively short in playing time, were all very interesting, and they were all very different from one another. I was adequately entertained by all segments in season one, aside from the one with yoghurt - as it was just downright ludicrous.I liked the variation in different art and animation styles, because it gave the show a very unique quality. And it made it all the more fun to watch, compared to if every single story had been presented in the same manner of animation and art style.One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb, however, was the pointless display of nudity in many of the segments. It felt forced and just dumbed down the segment unnecessarily. They should not have opted to force in all the nudity, because it served no purpose whatsoever.The animation was quite interesting and top notch in each segment, despite the varied styles used. So there definitely is something for almost everybody here. The voice acting was also quite good.All in all, \"Love, Death & Robots\" is definitely worth checking out, and I am quite glad that I did.\n",
            "While definitely visually stunning, many if the stories were very lacking. Some had bad punch lines, some had no punch lines, although some were pretty good. I definitely feel like a lot of the high ratings are based off people rating before watching too many episodes. I definitely do think they're on to something over here. The animation is amazing, and I love the idea of the short episodes. The only thing that needs a major change is the writing.\n",
            "The series is a beautiful short stories. For all people who loved Black Mirror, this series will be onyour favorite list.\n",
            "I didn't know what to expect when stepping into Love, Death + Robots, but I certainly didn't think I'd feel blown away and left wanting more after every episode.Each episode is beautifully written; the animation quality, music score and acting make each episode an individual masterpiece.\n",
            "There are many ups and downs in this show. However, I found most episodes enjoyable and easier to watch through. I loved the mesmerizing topics about space, science, and nature that this show presented. Overall, volume 1 was the best by a mile. Volume 1 had the best characters, storylines, and everything else. I would give volume 1 a 9/10 or a 10/10. However, I can't say the same about volume 2. I did like the concepts, just not as much as I liked volume 1's concepts. The show sometimes felt dry, and it was the most tame out of all of them. There would only be a couple episodes I would recommend. Volume 2 gets a 6/10 or a 7/10. On the other hand, they made a comeback with volume 3. Volume 3 was a breath of fresh air from volume 2, and I loved the concepts. It was tame, but not as tame as volume 2 and not as exposed as volume 1. The episodes were more intriguing to watch, and volume 3 gets a 8/10. If this show is getting a new volume, I hope they keep up the comeback because this show could go the mile.\n",
            "1st season, incredible, but I liked some episodes more than others. 2nd season was just perfect. I saw some complaints of lack of story, well if you have a decent attention span that is not a problem and you will get it. Less dialogue doesn't mean lack of story people. It makes when the characters do talk more impactful.\n",
            "Have been looking for entertainment like this and it's been ages since i have seen stories like this.Truely a work of ary.\n",
            "S1 is great. More than great. Astonishing animation with lots of great plots. Food for thought. It leaves you with a desire to go deeper into the meaning. S2 was great animation. Poor plots. Like you see a scene from a film. But not getting anything more than that. And only 8 episodes. So I guess that season 2&3 were one season split into two parts. I hope the good staff comes from episode 9-18.\n",
            "It's really freaking weird. But it's very unpredictable and I was constantly caught off guard. That's what made it fascinating to me the way a dystopian should. However, animations talking about and having sex along with the animated nudity was over the top for me and I felt like the show didn't need it.\n",
            "Season 1 is incredible - it came out of nowhere and it was such a blast. Lots of unexpected animation shorts which were very different but also sharp, peculiar, vivid, sarcastic, heroic, dreamy and many other things - and above all, great fun.In comparison, Season 2 is a bland, uneventful and twice as short. Just a few episodes are made in distinctive style, the rest is just high quality 3D animation, and almost none of them except maybe the first and the last really stand out from the story/idea perspective.\n",
            "Watched this based on a recommendation from a friend and I am beyond impressed. Some of the episodes like 2 and 13 (Lucky 13) I had to watch multiple times, just so good. This is must watch sci-fi as far as im concerned.\n",
            "Very enjoyable series with a lot of good and interesting episodes. I love the different animation styles and the very intense stories. There are some weaker episodes too, thats why I gave it a 9.\n",
            "This series is a set of incredibly well crafted short stories, which is especially impressive given that the longest episode is no more than 25 minutes long. I cannot recommend this series enough. The only thing I feel 100% justified in criticizing is the need to have some form of nudity in every episode. Sure there are the ones where it works to the betterment of the plot/setting. But some of the episodes felt like they strictly had nudity just to fit the rating, not that I'm complaining or anything, but I feel like it takes away from some of the stories when every time you see someone in a conversation, they're completely or majoritively naked.\n",
            "I have to say I've never given a 10/10 rating before, but this merits it.\n",
            "Pure genius! Definitely has a Black Mirror vibe which can never be a bad thing.\n",
            "Each episode stands alone in its brilliancy.\n",
            "Can't wait for more.......... well done to all involved in making this masterpiece!\n",
            "Been waiting this mature style of japanimatiion like films forever to hit the US...this series is a homerun with a edge only also found in Black Mirror and Phillip Dick's series.\n",
            "Not every episode hits the mark but most do. Some have a blade runneresque feel Exceptional animated detail and exciting stories.I have read negative comments like the Wired review but I think they are bringing their own preconcieved biases unfortunately.Weird and wonderful.\n",
            "The first season was great. The show was new and they had done some work on it.It was a creative work with good stories.The second season hadn't that good stories, but it still was good.In this season (the third one) although the animations have improved a little, there's no new story or creative elements\n",
            "that capture your attention.\n",
            "Being a big sci-fi fan and gamer, this is totally something else. Words can't explain how much I loved it. Tim Miller take bow fantastically directed, the whole team who came up with these theories and make it visually spectacular for us to watch I bow down to you. One of the best things I've seen in my life.\n",
            "Most people would agree that Love, Death & Robots is a mixed bag, only no one will agree on the mix. Someone online wrote a ranked listicle that put the amazingly animated The Witness dead last, which lead people in the comments to create their own radically different lists, none of which I agreed with.I've seen about half of season one, and most episodes have been good-to-great. My favorite is easily the very funny Three Robots. I also thought The Witness and Yogurt were terrific and quite enjoyed some of the others.But like everyone else, my list would be unique to me. So far my least favorite episode is easily Beyond the Aquila Rift, which is half softcore cartoon sex and half set up for a predictable twist, but it's got the highest IMDB user rating of the whole season.So watch an episode. If you don't like it, watch another. Sooner or later you'll find something you like, and wind up writing your own list that no one agrees with.\n",
            "Was recommended this show by a lot of people who's opinion i normally trust, but after watching the show I'm left guessing myself; \"Am I the weird one?\" Everyone else likes this show yet i find it lacking.First off the show looks amazing, at least most of the episodes. The distinct styles are all very original and beautiful to look at, for the most part. I would especially pull forward the episodes: \"The Witness\" and \"The Secret War\" as being very aesthetically pleasing. But this is not one of my criticisms of the show, my disappointment is with the writing.I feel like (almost) all episodes creative compelling worlds but fail to tell an engaging story within them. Very few of the Episodes take advantage of the short format to create a compelling story, the only ones in my opinion are \"Beyond the Aquila Rift\" \"When the Yogurt Took Over\" and \"Zima Blue\". These are well built stories that fit within the length of their episodes and don't overstay their welcome. A lot of the other episodes feel less like a tv-show and more like a tech-demo for a new game engine.Also what's the deal with including cats in like every episode?\n",
            "The slow burn of the last fifteen years has generally seen a decline into the mindless, passionless, and outright stupid fall of great visual dynamic storytelling.Love, Death and Robots Volume 2 has remedied everything I have been missing as an adult storytellers and lover of rich dynamic stories.The realism of the CGI will make you think you are looking at real people. It is so unbelievable great!!!\n",
            "No where near as great as Vol 1, plus 10 episodes shorts of Vol 1 as well. Felt a little lack lustre this time round. A few of the episodes were great, but over all Vol 1 was spectacular.\n",
            "Every 6 months or so I feel the need to browse through these episodes and randomy watch.\n",
            "Every story is a visual and poetic master piece weather you are into sci-fi, anime or not. It takes you to different universes at each episode and it only gets better. Enjoy the ride. no more words can justify what it is.Netflix should keep this alive.\n",
            "This is amazing!!!\n",
            "The best I've seen lately\n",
            "I think it makes no sense to add anything to the above, just look at the first novelty, carefully, being ready for an uncontrollable immersion into the whirlpool of high-quality fiction.The only regret is that I watched all the episodes so quickly.I wonder when is the second season?\n",
            "One of the only shows with true substance. Love it. Netflix needs more of these. A little bit of everything for everyone. Mostly apocalyptic but very good, it gives a hope for the future. I give it a 10/10.\n",
            "I went into watching this with some scepticism because animation that veers towards the more end of the spectrum can all too often be all style and little substance.This has both.It is an utterly absorbing and at times enthralling collection of varied short animated stories that go from comedy, love, sci-fi, fantasy and horror (sometimes combining more than one genre), each with an interesting message to take, that is not always obvious at the start.Some of the animation is superb and the creative minds often sublime.Not always for the fainthearted and definitely adults only.At times your emotions will be like a rollercoaster and even your morals and ethic uncomfortably ruffled but with a delicious feeling that is almost intoxicating.It's like the best of foods. One nibble and you suddenly can't resist wanting more.There is one thing missing from the creators and writers, a full, feature length movie, which would be a mind bending blockbuster if they ever decide to put their minds to what they have the undoubted ability to achieve.\n",
            "I'm not even sure where to begin, I wish these stories were never ending. Pure brilliance.\n",
            "After ever story my jaw had to be manually closed.\n",
            "Hope in humanity restored!\n",
            "But very good quality. I watched without getting bored. Season 1 was better but still nice.\n",
            "Each one of these short masterpieces is thought-provoking. By turns hilarious, tense, poignant and transcendent, each episode is perfectly realised and just as long as it needs to be. And yet most contain the potential for an hour-long or even feature-length treatment. The result is that we get intense espresso shots of invention. Some of these will haunt you.\n",
            "This is one of the best things on planet earth.Every episode has me completely baffled.3 volumes? I will watch them\n",
            "all in one sitting. Which of course, is not healthy.But watch me.\n",
            "I actually have no idea how to disprove what I just saw. Watched all seasons at once. Did like all stories, but still awesome to watch. Some stories surprised me, I honestly hope that I interpret them as the writers intended. Great watch!\n",
            "One of the most beautiful and creative collections of animations and CGI. The story, the colours. Wow. I can't wait to see the next season. Please do it again soon. I am so hanging out. This is an outstanding piece of creativity.\n",
            "Season 1 was just great. Really fresh and original, with some very memorable and clever stories.Season 2 was largely a write-off. I did like ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE and the wistful state-of-things commentary of THE DROWNED GIANT. Also ICE was beautiful to watch. But the insultingly bad POP SQUAD nearly ruined the whole experience.I highly recommend watch Season 1, it's great. Treat Season 2 as an also-ran, a time-filler merely for completeness' sake.Sadly, I think Season 2 indicates Netflix have lost interest and there probably won't be a Season 3 collection - or it will be as brief, dull and stupid as Season 2.\n",
            "Haven't finish all episodes, but despite just a short stories, the copywriting, storyline, character building, ANIMATION QUALITY applied on character's emotion is ... I lost words.. words cant describe it.. just beyond everything, thank you whoever creates these masterpieces, please make it REAL MOVIES and take ma money.. THIS IS ART!\n",
            "For what it is, it's amazing. I never expected them to fit a riveting storyline in 10 minute episodes. What each episode does is it feel like you're dropped in to witness a portion of an ongoing saga that you will force you to imagine the beginning and the end on your own. But make no mistake, the 10 minutes you're in it is simply wild. I really appreciate the brutality and realism they depict and eagerly await the next season. Definitely not for kids.\n",
            "Season one, wow. I still rewatched something of my favorites. Such mind bending ideas and twisty plots. I was so impressed by this original idea of adult animation. Just Like Netflix does, they hook you in with the initial concept and originality. If you're wanting to watch something compelling yet not too long as to where you get bored or distracted easily. Watch season one. Won't regret it.Now season two...I can't say I'm really surprised. Netflix has this horrible reputation of ruining great original ideas and pumping them dry until they are almost universally hated. 8 episodes after a 18 episode first season. I mean come on. The spark that captured a lot of viewers originally has completely vanished. Maybe it's one of those concepts that really can't redo the beauty of what came before. But this was a pathetic attempt. Personally, I blame Netflix for most likely heavy handing the production. This felt like a corporate, PG-13, cash grabby rip off of the first season. Visuals are still extremely impressive, but the over all quality of story telling and original ideas is lacking anything fresh or shocking. Which in my mind, is what season one did so well. Originally it was a 9/10. Sadly, it's fallen to a 6. Very disappointed.\n",
            "First season: Bloody sensational. Good stories, interesting interpretations and visuals. Entertaining at it's best\n",
            "Second and Third seasons: One word: meh.\n",
            "I don't understand the high rating. At first I thought it was all paid reviews, but it turns out some people actually like this show. The animation is charming in places. Otherwise you'll find the worst writing you've ever encountered with pointless storylines. Shockingly terrible. Don't waste your time.\n",
            "The animation from episode to episode uses different styles but is all absolutely wonderful. The stories, some bizarre, some dark, some downright hilarious are all gripping from start to finish. I have only one problem with this show and its by no way a criticism its more due to my own greed, so many of these short stories should be feature length films!!\n",
            "I love this series! Couldn't get enough of it! Its so different from anything else! Cant wait for season 2!\n",
            "Review for novastreamnetwork.comLove, Death & Robots is an artistically well written anthology series. Its 18 episodes are all influenced by animation and is probably the most exciting series released on Netflix in a very long time. The series is very NSFW with the amount of nudity and cursing in almost every episode. But the animation in every single one of these stories is unique in its own way. The short stories are easy to get through as they fly by and you'll wish it was a feature film.18 episodes, 18 short films, all under 20 minutes runtime. They're all science fiction based, and David Fincher (Gone Girl) is the executive producer of this series. The idea came from none other than creator Tim Miller (Deadpool). Some of the shorts are based on literature, some are completely original stories being told in their own extraordinary way. They all have a different theme, a certain twist to them that leaves you begging for more and their own style of writing that makes every episode unpredictable. Most of these \"mini-movies\" will make you think about things in a different way and truly blow you away. And yes, not every story will be your taste, but in my case, there were only two of them that didn't compel me in any way. Some of the more endearing, longer episodes could easily be turned into blockbusters - the quality is just spectacular.Whichever one will be your favourite, truly depends on your own personal taste. There's some very realistic animation in a few of them that makes you question if these are real actors on screen (there's only one episode that actually uses real life actors without any mocap) or computer-generated images. Some other styles reminded me more of a European animated style and even manga passes by.Like I said before, there's a lot of nudity and swearing, and in some of the episodes it feels a little bit out of place. Mostly because of the animation style that feels more \"kid-friendly\" - don't get me wrong, this show is strictly for adults only! But other than that, in some episodes it really adds to the whole of the story.A reoccurring theme is obviously the titular three - Love, Death and Robots. These three themes will either go hand in hand with each other and other times you'll only see one of these incorporated into the story. It all depends on the subject. Ideas around humanity's future, our own demise and the relationship we have with space and other species is explored over and over again. It never feels preachy throughout the series and makes you laugh, feel sad or truly terrify you.Each and every animator that has worked on this is talented and has their own vision on how to tell a story with their certain technique of animation. The beautify of this anthology series is that there's going to be something for everyone.Top 3 episodes:Episode 1 - Sonnie's Edge: In the underground world of \"beastie\" fights, Sonnie is unbeatable - as long as she keeps her edge.\n",
            "Episode 14 - Zima Blue: The renowned artist Zima recounts his mysterious past and rise to fame before unveiling his final work.\n",
            "Episode 2 - Three Robots: Long after the fall of humanity, three robots embark on a sightseeing tour of a post-apocalyptic city.Bottom 3 episodes:Episode 8 - Good Hunting: The son of a spirit hunter forges a bond with a shape-shifting huli jing.\n",
            "Episode 13 - Lucky 13: After the drop-ship Lucky 13 lost two crews, no pilot would fly her... but rookies don't get a choice.\n",
            "Episode 18 - Secret War: Elite units of the Red Army fight an unholy evil deep in the ancient forests of Siberia.Love, Death & Robots is one of the most unusually artistic shows of the year. Don't miss out on watching this ASAP!Love, Death & Robots is available to stream on Netflix.\n",
            "This is one amazing show.Episode 1 - Sonníe´s Edge & Shape Shifter were AMAZING(the latter had me almost in tears).But all episodes were magnificent. This is a must watch.Just speechless.\n",
            "I'm so mad at season two because I watched it all in one evening and now demand more. This is such a fun and thought provoking show. Please make more!\n",
            "It's a shame that I can only review the two seasons bundled together.Season 1 is absolutely fantastic. Even the episodes that I enjoyed less have a story and something to make you think about. Great stuff, really! Graphic is great, many different styles.Season 2 is trash. NONE of the 8 episodes has any merit whatsoever. The episodes are way too short, they have but a basic (often cliche) idea and even that doesn't get unfolded. Graphic is of course great but it's mainly game-like 3D (showing a rendered face from up close is apparently the rage). A huge let-down after Season 1. I'm shocked that critics love S2 so much.Season 1: 10\n",
            "Season 2: 1\n",
            "Average: 5.5 (rounded up to 6)\n",
            "Not all the episodes are great, but most of them, for sure... I think it is a try-out for netflix, the best ones survive. Mayby a netflix Movie in the future!\n",
            "Seriously. I paused it mid way through the first episode to leave a review to encourage ppl to watch this. Animation is amazing, the story telling is impressive especially in 17 minutes. Not sure how every episode after the first will pan out but the pilot shows ridiculous promise. This is no animation for kids thats for sure. A lot of people are really gonna enjoy this, i know i am\n",
            "This series takes you to landscapes and cities that push the boundaries of imagination.Honestly, I didn't expect it to be so good. Although each story is short, it contains a world of its own wtih different concepts of life. A great series to watch.\n",
            "When I saw this on Netflix, I admit I was skeptical. I thought it might go down the way of some of Netflix's other animated shows (which can be very hit-or-miss). When I saw the reviews, I was still skeptical, so thought I would give it a go.Just watched the first few episodes straight through and the reviews check out. For me it came off a lot like a Ken Lieu compilation of short stories, with each piece delivering as much wonder and captivation as the one before.I would give this show 9/10, but the innovation behind the idea, as well as the animation, easily bump it up to a 10.\n",
            "Wow. just wow. Love, Death and Robots is an amazing eye catching short story show that just wowed every second. For Netflix's first NSFW show, it really delivered and this will for sure set a path for future shows like this down the road. Love Love Love! ❤\n",
            "I'm not one for reviews so this will be short and to the point. It's true what another reviewer said.. once you start watching you just can't stop! The only gripe is that each episode is very short and they leave you wanting more (it's an anthology series).Do yourself a favour... Clear an afternoon and binge this amazing series (not for the kids!)\n",
            "\"Love, Death + Robots is such a unique series, combined with incrediblely high level animation and live-action, with a great and interesting different story in every each episode, makes Love, Robots + Death a fantastic journey, i highly recommended\"\n",
            "The visuals, the music, the story, cyberpunk. It's all amazing!\n",
            "After a fantastic first season, which had great animation and CGI, creative and thought-provoking stories, and stellar voice acting; we now have season 2. Season 1 had a modest 18 shorts, whereas season 2 only has only 8 episodes. Season 2 is still a really solid season, which offers some of the best episodes in the show, like Pop Squad and Snow in the Desert, but it's lacking the content that season 1 had.And since some of these shorts are so good, I really I hope that Netflix turns some of these episodes into full length movies or TV series. Stories like Pop Squad, Beyond the Aquila Rift, The Secret War, and Snow in the Desert are simply too good to be 20 minutes or shorter. Aside from that, Love, Death & Robots is a great show. It pushes the boundaries of CGI technology and it offers some really cool looking animation. Now I'm just hoping that we get more content if there's a season 3.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots Season 2: Just 8 episodes of the Animated SF series this time but all are worth watching.Pop Squad based on a story by Paolo Bacigalupi is about a future where humans are \"immortal\" but procreation is banned. Well imagined, luxury and decay. Resistance might be futile but ... 9/10Snow In The Desert brings one of Neal Asher's Polity stories to life ( well, animation). Fights between Golem Androids, Human Cyborgs and humans. All set on a desert world where the secret of a human's immortality makes him the target of bounty hunters and attracts the attention of the Polity A. I.s. Who send an Earth Central Intelligence agent. 9/10.Malfunctioning robots, an Alien style Santa, Humans and the Modified, Creatures in the grass and a giant corpse also figure. Tim Miller is the Showrunner with multiple directors and screenwriters. On Netflix. 9/10.\n",
            "Beautiful, animation and the whole concept is amazing. You don't even have to watch all of the episodes but i truly recommend it!\n",
            "I sat and refreshed Netflix until 3:30am waiting for this to come out earlier this morning. Since I'm a night person I was able to start this and didn't stop watching until I saw every episode at like 7am.This was SO good. Some of the animation was so amazing I had to Google to make sure it was all animated as some of the segments could actually be mistaken as real actors. Short of one segment with Topher Grace, it is ALL animated. Every single episode of this was original and incredibly well done, hopefully this gets enough support to warrant a season two.If you like adult animation at all, or science fiction... Or even fantasy there will definitely be a lot here for you to like. I honestly have no complaints, there was nothing about it I didn't like, thus the perfect 10 star review. I hardly ever rate shows unless they are exceptionally great or exceptionally bad, luckily this falls in the first category.\n",
            "I enjoyed this series a lot. The animation is fantastic, the stories interesting and I'm a sucker for Sci fi so it ticked a load of boxes for me.For the most part it's an enjoyable experiment that reminded me of reading my dad's old 70's short story collections. When one story underwhelms you it doesn't matter because its short and there's another one coming up.The issues I have with it are something Sci fi has struggled with forever. The characters come across as if they're written by a teenage boy. They're all tough and fight regardless of the consequences, they use swear words, they're just so cool! Only the issue is they're not. They're outdated clichés and I'm bored silly if them.Also most female characters seem to exist as tools to men or convenient breasts. Granted the helping hand story didn't do that (one of the stronger episodes) but she was tough and swore a lot.To summarize this is great stuff. Talented animators create interesting worlds (Good huntings Hong Kong was great) that grip me to the screen wondering what the next one will be. Its just let down a little bit by its sometimes weak cliche characters.Sci fi can really prosper in animated form and I look forward to another series.\n",
            "This is by far the best animated show I ever saw! Don't miss it!\n",
            "Season one was a solid 9/10 for me. It mixed a diverse and often incredible array of animation styles.The writing, likewise, was much more hit than miss. Even when it missed, the stories were still entertaining enough to keep you hooked for the next.Thought provoking, funny, creepy, weird, sexy, cute, ugly, and everything in-between got covered, and covered well.With it sitting at 18 short episodes, you could comfortably crack a few beers, and treat it as a lengthy feature movie experience, and not get bored.Then there is season two...Painfully short, at 8 episodes. This felt like much less of an event. Just as you are settling in, it's over.This isn't helped, by a much weaker selection of stories and in some cases, animation.Granted, some are interesting. The first, \"Automated Customer Service\", is funny, if taken a little too far, to the point of silly. \"Snow in the Desert\" is beautifully animated, and has a nice straightforward story, and the drowned giant, although slow is strangely enthralling and meditative (if poorly placed, as the last episode).Then there are episodes like \"Ice\". Which feels like filler. Lacking interesting animation, or any story of note. And Pop Squad, which while stunning to look at, feels like an idea that needs much more run time to be effective.Season two isn't bad, per se. Its just nowhere close to its preceeding season in quality, and it feels a lot like Netflix rushed it out, in order to cash in on the popularity of the first.Here's hoping Netflix can redeem themselves with a bigger, ballsier season three. (But I fear we'll just get the other 8 episodes that were cynically withheld from season two!?!)\n",
            "It's as good or better than any CGI movie out there. Is raw as F\n",
            "Finnaly an original animation series for adults. So original so brilliant I can't stop watching it. The short episodes keep me so engagded. I just want more and more. Please deliver more content like this.\n",
            "I liked each and every short story, nothing is bad or boring.\n",
            "I wonder how best these guys have given in a short time.\n",
            "And also some episodes which has insane graphics...\n",
            "Hats off to the effort 😍\n",
            ".\n",
            ".\n",
            "Needed Season 2\n",
            "I found out about the series while casually strolling on the 9GAG. I can't thank enough the poster that brought the show to my attention.It is pure magic...When I saw David Fincher mentioned I knew it will be a work of art.It consists of 18 episodes of different stories and art styles, all of them beautiful and intriguing. They will absorb you. They will make you laugh, question things, leave you mesmerized and sad, shocked and excited. Wanting for more the most. And that is exactly why art exists. Art style ranges from steampunk to Mass Effect like Sci-Fi, photo realistic CGI, to Animatrix and Pixar like. It is as if Tim Miller and David Fincher made a best of compilation from animated world.\n",
            "This animated anthology is truly awesome.\n",
            "And for anyone that is a true fan of sci-fi fantasy horror, and Japanese anime. This is the series for you. Not only is this series brimming with great storytelling and stunning visuals. But it is absolutely brilliant. It is a must-see series.\n",
            "And also, Netflix should not be hesitating in commissioning a 2nd season.\n",
            "LD&R is just an animated Black Mirror (in a good way).\n",
            "Since spider man came up last year, i could smell that one great evolution of animation is coming up. Higher free degree showing up in the animation industry, we will get more and more artworks like this.\n",
            "BTW, the witness and helping hand and good hunting are still blowing my mind!!!!!!!\n",
            "Despite the fact that this kind of animation series are not my cup of tea I found some of them really good. Blood, sex, violence and rude language everywhere is the part I enjoyed the most. I'd highlight 'The witness' and 'Kill team kill' as my fav. And as the odd one out that didn't fit in here but I liked was the one about yoghurt dictatorial regime in our society.\n",
            "I had no idea I needed this show in my life but I did. And I am so grateful, Netflix! All my years of TV watching, all the years of netflix.. have led up to this show. I am overwhelmed. I am shocked. This was god-sent! 18 perfections, My God!\n",
            "The message it conveys, the graphics, the duration, the concept, all this is amazing! The chapter \"Beyond the crack of Aquila\" has crazy graphics. It looks so real!\n",
            "It has been quite some years I've sat to watch an anthology, but this, the animation, the stories, the emotion. Quite frankly,I would call this one of the pinnacles of cinema and a masterpiece if I ever saw one.PS: Lots of sex, nudity and gore. Just Brilliant!!!!\n",
            "I barely give ten to a tv series or a movie.but i must say this show is absolutly fantastic.\n",
            "Watched every episode in one sitting. Even the stories that weren't my cup of tea were brilliant and held my interest. The short running time does nothing to hinder the stories. One of the best things Netflix has ever had on offer.\n",
            "The animationI is great the writing is awesome holy s%$# this is the coolest show I've seen I awhile I am speechless its so good\n",
            "Breathtaking animation and superb writing makes this series refreshing and exciting theough its 18 episodes.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots is the new original Netflix animated series. The first time I heard this show was being produced, I was reading some news, when I suddenly saw the headline of this new animated show from Netflix, produced by David Fincher and Tim Miller. That caught my eye, obviously.After watching the trailer, I was all in. It looked fresh and unique. After watching the series I can confirm. It's both of those things. The series is very experimental, different episodes, different styles. Each style of animation is unique in it's own way.The series is episodic. It's not a linear story told through multiple episodes. Which is good because a series like this becomes a playground for all the directors. Now, you may think that this is good. And you're right, it is. When it works.Some directors are concerned in telling a story, others are concerned in experimenting. An example of this is: Zima Blue, one of the best episodes, because it's really telling a story about deconstruction, literally and figuratively, while using it's beautiful style of animation to emphasise the artistic nature of the character. On the other hand, the episode, Alternate Stories, is about different ways of killing Hitler. Yes, you just read that. It is as simple as it looks. Which makes the episode silly, becoming repetitive very fast.Love, Death & Robots is good. Yes, it is experimental. Some episodes are more inventive than others. But, I have to commend Netflix for it, even though it has those issues. Watching the episodes are to say the least, fun. One of the best series Netflix produced in quite some time.\n",
            "First of all, the visuals were outstanding. There were many different types of animation and some of them were breathtaking.The stories were another machine altogether. Most of the stories were written by men that were based on stories written by men. A bit convoluted but there you go. Alberto Mielgo is a prepubescent boy hiding in the body of a man and this is obvious to anyone that looks at his work. I no longer wonder why Sony fired him. Philip Gelatt has very little talent which is probably why they get him to rewrite crappy stories into even crappier stories. Maybe he has a brain parasite that only allows him to interpret everything into a teenage boy's wet dream, lol. Who knows? Who cares?I saw a lot of sex, and machines/robots being sexualized but I didn't see any love. The series should have been called sex, death and robots. The stories themselves were unoriginal and for the most part, boring. Lots of war/blowing things up, trying to be clever, but it's all old and it's awful.Not impressed but had to give it a 3 out of 10 for the animation style and that's it.\n",
            "I have to agree on the reviews on here that Netflix has made a superior show with great acting story telling and over the top violence. Just hope they make a second season thumps up\n",
            "Amazing and very entertaining. I hope it gets season 2. Favourite episodes: Beyond the Aquila Rift, Sucker of Souls, Good Hunting, Shape Shifters.\n",
            "If you like Black Mirror.. Well.. You'll love this. Love, Death & Robots is a series of short films with completely different backstories and design. It's hard to describe the series as anything else than a masterpiece. Most of the episodes looks like a cinematic scene/clip from a video game - we're talking Blizzard Entertainment level folks. I freaking love it! I need more.\n",
            "Artistic freedom produces masterpieces like this series of episodes.Episodes that otherwise will have never seen the light and we will poorer...Every episode is a masterpiece in its own form.Congrats to everyone and of course thank you for giving this to us!!!\n",
            "This is the best thing I have seen in a long time.\n",
            "Gorgeous animation, brilliant story telling and lots of violence.\n",
            "How I wish there was more like this.\n",
            "Highly recommended.\n",
            "Changed my review and now 10/10 after watching Season 3. Season 1 was amazing, season 2 was crap but season 3 hits the spot again!Glad Netflix picked it up again as they are sitting on a gold mine. It is a very good production too bad season 2 now sits in the middle as the dark sheep.\n",
            "We all are painfully aware the quality has decreased in season 2. Less episodes, less meat to the stories. I'm comforted that I wasnt the only one disappointed. But I truly think if they just rewatch their own season 1 and understand what made it work. That they will somehow bring it back for 3. Here's hoping.\n",
            "It's unique and fresh. Just watch it! Thanks Netflix for this masterpiece!\n",
            "There a few episodes that are really enjoyable, a few that are average and the odd stinker. I found in series 1, quite a lot of the stories were very similar, and contrary to what I have read from other reviewers, I found series 2 and 3 to be more enjoyable. There are definitely standout episodes - for me the witness, beyond the Aquila rift and zima blue (style over substance but they're so short that's kind of a given), and then some that I found to be very boring watches like lucky 13 and the secret war. Overall, don't give this a miss, again, some are better than others but I think the point is that many different stories and styes are showcased, so everybody will have their favourites.\n",
            "A series of science fiction shorts, just with any doctor would order. Astonishingly wonderful. Absolutely the best television/series type show I've watch this season without a doubt. Creative, artistic, varied material each segment, all of the shorts are 10 to 20 minute snippets from quite different producers with completely different plots... some more creative than others. The \"yogurt that took over the world\" was my favorite this season, even though they were more powerful episodes. Enjoy!\n",
            "However this happened needs to be repeated over and over. If this was the only thing on Netflix I would be happy. The whole collection was incredible and I can't wait for more.\n",
            "Every episode is outstanding, from the varying visuals to original storylines. It's heavy metal meets black mirror. Working off the genius of twilight zone and outer limits. The perfect series for our generation.\n",
            "I was browsing through Netflix and spotted this title. It mentioned robots and I like those so I thought, \"why not?\" And I am so very glad I did! It was not what I was expecting at all.Comparisons to The Animatrix are well founded and, after watching a few of the animations, it was exactly what came to my mind as well. Another film it brought to my mind was \"The ABC's of Death\" as it shared the same kind of genre hopping content, even though ABCoD was purely a horror film.Each episode is a short story lasting around 15-20 minutes on average. They cross a number of genres from sci-fi to comedy and straight up horror. All are strikingly animated and, at times, the animation is so good that it's easy to forget you're not actually looking at flesh and blood people. I think there were actually only a couple of stories where I didn't like the animation, but this was more down to my personal taste i think.The stories themselves are well written and there isn't really a weak one in the bunch. Again, there were a couple which I didn't enjoy as much which was more about my own likes and dislikes than anything they did wrong but, the great thing about an anthology, is you don't have to wait very long for another one to come along.A quick word about the 18 rating. It absolutely deserves that classification as the violence can be quite startling at times in how graphic it can be. Similarly, when you get to the SEX part of the title, this series pulls no punches whatsoever, as it is just as graphic as the violence i.e. It doesn't shy away from detail! So, not the kind of cartoon you can settle your kids down in front of. Likewise, don't sit down to watch it with your nan, because explaining exactly what's going on may prove to be rather uncomfortable (unless your nan is very broadminded.)So, recommended? Absolutely, just make sure your kids and elderly relatives are well out of harms way!\n",
            "While watching, I had this overwhelming feeling of nostalgia and deja vu. Then I realized I was having that because this series is like a modern day, NSFW, Ray Bradbury short story compilation. A little bit of horror, a lot of sci-fi and a sprinkle of wtf thrown in for good measure. I am completely in love with this series and I hope they do many more seasons.\n",
            "This is an interesting series of short films.Some are very good, some not so good, but overall well worth watching.Some of the stories are funny, some have got a serious message and some are just plain weird.I think that it better to binge watch a few episodes at a time to help to get you \"In the mood\".I've seen the first two series and will watch the third in a week or so and so far there has only been two episodes that I didn't really like, but that is just my point of view. Some people will like all of them, some will only like a few.Happy watching.\n",
            "What a gem, among all the utter garbage on subscription tv it is such a pleasure to come across something original, engrossing and unique. It's sometimes difficult to believe that animation could get this good.\n",
            "Great adult animation. The stories and art styles are varied throughout the series. Some stories were better than others, but that's just a matter of individual taste. All episodes are interesting and very well done, however. If you liked Heavy Metal, chances are you'll love this. Can't wait for series 2.\n",
            "This has set itself as this generation's Heavy Metal, though it is probably even better, in my opinion. The writing is outstanding, with each episode having its own unique feel and theme. The CG is absolutely amazing. What they produced is even better than Alita.I really hope this is Tim Miller's way of getting more movement on the Neuromancer film. If this is a preview of what he could do with that source material, I cannot wait.If you like original ideas, just sit and enjoy this one...just not with your kids or parents.\n",
            "This show has everything a Netflix binger, or anyone for that matter, could possibly want in a TV series, breathtaking visuals, gritty and superb violence, brilliantly written narrative, and due to each episode being so relatively short there is absolutely no nonsense with this series. I cannot praise this show highly enough. 11/10\n",
            "This was an amazing surprise, totally random,didn't see any advertising for it.Every episode, unique, interesting, beautifully animated.A little black mirror feel to it, but every idea is flawlessly pulled off.Would recommend anyone to check this out, you will be hooked after the first episode.\n",
            "Normally I'm not into anim or animated stuff or over violent content, but I saw an episode was just 12 minutes or so, so I gave it a go when I was a bit bored. And what a pleasant surprise it was! Because the episodes are so short, there is no filler at all and they just leave you wanting more after each story. From science fiction to comedy to thriller, it just keeps hopping genres, which is also what keeps it so fresh. I just which there were more episodes, absolutely brilliant!\n",
            "I cant even imagine, how did human kind make this amazing serie.\n",
            "Series with episodes all disconnected really beautiful and very original, each episode has a different plot and they are all however connected by the title that requires it to be a story with a more or less common theme.\n",
            "This collection of 18 animated short movies is marvelous! Each one of them has a smart story and an exciting staging. We need more stuff of that kind. Thank you Netflix for this masterpiece!\n",
            "I never write reviews but I really hope Tim Miller and co. bring us a season 2! Like Black Mirror and the Animatrix, it weaves weird and awesome stories with visual flair!\n",
            "This is basically a darker, more gritty Black Mirror animation and it is perfect in so many ways.\n",
            "I watched the whole show in one session when I visited my best friend last week. I heard a lot of positive feedback before so I was pretty excited to watch it. I was hooked by the first episode within the first 5 minutes. Great animation great story and one hell of a plot twist. When episode two started I got behind the concept of the show with every episode being an independent kinda short movie. You could almost see every episode like a teaser trailer. And hell yeah these are some of the craziest teasers I ever seen. Almost every episode could be a full length movie or a series on its own. The animation work is top notch from beginning to end and the story ideas are very innovative and diversified. As soon as one episode ended I couldn't help but ask myself what the next one will be like. I really liked the fresh concept of this show and I hope there will be more such projects in near future.\n",
            "You can see plenty of this sort of thing on youtube. I did enjoy for what it was but alot of this needed longer. If they gave every \"episode\" half an hour or an hour I think it would have worked better. Alot of them felt like video game trailers. However, there are some really interesting episodes that given more time would prove amazing and the talent on show is quite clearly very good. Definitely worth a watch bit don't believe the hype.\n",
            "This is something completely different, completely new but still so watchable... Genious!\n",
            "You definitely need to watch. everything is perfect...\n",
            "Definitely not for kids! Love every story telling. Great job writers, artist, graphic artist all of the artist and sound producers!!!\n",
            "Now this is a anthology of short films of the highest caliber. Astonishing and beautiful animations and art styles of all different kinds. You don't need to know more - just check it out! Be warned though, many are violent and contain nudity so be sure to keep the kids far, far away!\n",
            "Al You Need To Know:Season 1: amazing, stunning animation and some very good stories (my favourite is Lucky 13).Season 2: good, pretty simple animation and none very good story, just some good ones.Season 3: delusional, simple animation (animation of season 1 was better, in my humble opinion) and just maybe three stories that were okay.Sadly Netflix uses to push on release the more the better, not checking the quality of the show. Especially after seeing that the first season goes well. That's a shame, really.\n",
            "Seriously epic stuff, only jist broke into the series and im already in awe of how rediculous it is. :)\n",
            "Season 1 featured 18 shorts that were, for the most part, very entertaining although often featuring nudity for the sake of nudity. They were short but told interesting stories that left you thinking about what might have happened after the ending. Seasons 2 and 3 have fewer but longer episodes, which is a blessing and a curse. There are fewer to bore you, but it takes longer to get through each one. They were almost all lessons in how great and photorealistic computer animation can be, but they lacked quality storytelling, not to mention that they were almost all dark and depressing. The only bright light was provided by the three robots. My rating of seven primarily speaks to the strength of the Season 1 offerings.\n",
            "I've never seen anything like this show. Just watch it, you won't regret it.\n",
            "Istantly hooked , each episode has its own style and theme but all have a great vibe , I could honestly watch a whole series of some of these episodes. Amazing animation from realistic to the comic book style but often with horror or a ...nsfw style so definitely not for the kids ! I would love to see a sonnies edge series or good hunting or others tbh. Confidence in Netflix series reaffirmed.\n",
            "NSFW has never been this good. With stories that contain different themes that will appeal to different people, this is one Netflix show that you don't want to miss.\n",
            "Me and my wife watch love death + robots and with each episode it just got better and better.\n",
            "I've never written any reviews before to start with. But this anthology right here is just something. The script, the animation, the gore. Everyone is just so well done. Netflix is really setting their own standards for their original shows.\n",
            "Love this every last one! Couldn't even tell lucky 13 was animated. Some were funny some made you think some had sad moment and some were scary (looking at you beyond the aquila rift) like black mirror every story is different yet entertaining. Looking forward to seeing more.\n",
            "It's brilliant in every direction you can imagine.\n",
            "E03&07&10&11&13&18, specially E07&18 were so real that freak me out a little. some of its stories were so weird and unique that I couldn't decide to love them or hate them. overall is something new in the world of copycat TV shows.\n",
            "Some of the animation here is on another level. Episode 3 is just utterly sublime, I just am blown away. We are witnessing the next generation of entertainment. To all to were party to this, we're just in awe. Go for it!\n",
            "Could not stop watching this series end to end. Each episode was unique in delivery, content and with no f__ks given attitude. While I would sensor from the young and immature this is defiantly a work of art in our cookie cutter society!\n",
            "Netflix out does themselves once again! I thought that Season 2 and Season 3 (Season 4 for me wasn't their best piece of work yet) of Black Mirror was boundary pushing television, but Love, Death + Robots delivers something unique once again!!18 themed short stories, each one having a unique story with some stunning production value and animation!Once you start watching you cant stop bingie watching till complete!Take a bow! Cant watch for Season 2 already!\n",
            "The writing, the characters, music... And animation styles made my jaw drop. Didn't expect this kind of quality content from Netflix. They really outdone themselves. Simply a masterpiece.\n",
            "This series impresses me most with its resplendent visual effects. The plots of most episodes are simple but \"magical\", with something either profound or amusing in behind. Some of the sexual contents are unnecessary in my opinion, for example in \"the dump\".\n",
            "Really nice series a lot of different individual stories that needs to continue. I'd wish some episodes would me longer tho :)\n",
            "The variety is one aspect that helps this show elevate to higher standards.Each one goes so fast you can downright hate an episode and still not have to devote an entire afternoon to the droll experience.I feel like this format suits me very well since I don't like to have things too drawn out. I like patient story telling but don't need padded run times.Fresh and inventive.Good on you NF.\n",
            "Season 1 : 8.5/10 - Except a couple of episodes , rest were watchable and animation was good.Season 2 : 7.5/10 - Some stories fell flat but the animation was superb as compared to the previous season.Season 3 : 8/10 - Here the animation and stories are better than S02 but the 3-4 stories had average content.Will update the review after successive seasons.\n",
            "I saw a trailer for this series a few weeks ago and didn't think about it much afterwards, then I was reading about this show on imdb and noticed David Fincher was involved, that's when I started to pay attention,\n",
            "So now I have seen 11 episodes so far I have to write a review or say something about it, I was a little skeptical after the first episode but then after episode 2 I was hooked, this is a masterpiece pure and simple, some excellent quality stories and each episode's animation is differant, from computerised animation to anime and then to good old fashioned animation, then back to animation I've never seen before, i highly recommend watching this show even if you don't normally watch animation, it's all about the stories, my personal favorite so far would be between suits ep 4, sucker of souls ep 5 but good hunting is an awsome episode too, I have to say that SUITS reminded me of Firefly the joss whedon cancelled way before its time show, I don't know why but it reminded me of that show, from the first 5 minutes I just thought firefly.? Do yerself a favour and watch this series, BRAVO NETFLIX keep on keeping on.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots, an anthology series created by Tim Miller and David Fincher, is a captivating collection of animated short stories that pushes the boundaries of imagination and storytelling. With its unique blend of diverse themes, stunning animation, and thought-provoking narratives, the series manages to leave a lasting impression on viewers. This review aims to explore the reasons why Love, Death & Robots deserves a solid 9/10 rating.One of the standout aspects of this anthology is its ability to seamlessly weave together various genres, ranging from science fiction and fantasy to horror and comedy. Each episode takes the audience on a different journey, allowing them to explore distinct worlds and experience a wide range of emotions. Whether it's the adrenaline-fueled action of \"Suits\" or the mind-bending existentialism of \"Beyond the Aquila Rift,\" Love, Death & Robots consistently delivers fresh and compelling narratives that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.The animation in Love, Death & Robots is nothing short of breathtaking. Each episode presents a unique visual style, showcasing the incredible talent and creativity of the animation teams involved. From the hyper-realistic CGI in \"Good Hunting\" to the visually stunning 2D animation in \"Zima Blue,\" the series demonstrates a remarkable attention to detail and a willingness to experiment with different artistic techniques. The visuals not only enhance the storytelling but also serve as a feast for the eyes, creating a truly immersive experience.Another strength of Love, Death & Robots lies in its ability to explore profound and thought-provoking themes within the constraints of a short format. Despite each episode's limited runtime, the series manages to delve into complex ideas such as artificial intelligence, the nature of consciousness, the fragility of human existence, and the consequences of technological advancements. These stories often leave viewers pondering the moral and ethical implications of the worlds presented, sparking deep discussions and contemplation.Moreover, the series excels at showcasing a diverse range of characters and perspectives. Love, Death & Robots embraces inclusivity and does not shy away from addressing social issues, be it gender identity, race, or sexuality. By incorporating a wide spectrum of human experiences, the series manages to create relatable and authentic characters that resonate with viewers on a personal level, fostering empathy and understanding.While Love, Death & Robots generally succeeds in delivering exceptional episodes, there are instances where the quality can be inconsistent. Due to the anthology format, some stories may resonate more strongly with viewers than others, and occasional dips in narrative depth or pacing may occur. Nevertheless, these minor shortcomings do not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment and impact of the series.In conclusion, Love, Death & Robots is a tour de force of animated storytelling. Its ability to seamlessly blend genres, stunning animation, thought-provoking themes, and diverse perspectives make it an absolute gem in the realm of anthology series. While it may not be perfect in every aspect, its overall excellence is undeniable. If you are a fan of imaginative narratives and breathtaking visuals, Love, Death & Robots is a must-watch experience that will leave you craving more.\n",
            "As with most anthologies, it's a mixed bag, but when it's great, it's amazing. Zima Blue is a masterpiece.\n",
            "This was just simply amazing. Every single episode was a story that I wish there was a whole 5 season story around. There was obviously episodes I like more then others but even the ones that's I liked less then others I'd still be watching over and over.Really hope this kind of sci-fi work keeps going and is out out there for fan just like Netflix did with this this one.I am sitting here looking for criticism but simply can't find it. Weather there is none or that the great moments just out shine the downfalls to the point of me not paying attention to them. Either way it is a absolute favorite. And something I have rewatched every month or two and enjoy just as much as the time before.\n",
            "I like the risks that are taken in this series. Episodes are almost always, politically correct, but there are a couple that include some non-political concepts that make people uncomfortable when thinking about them . . . And that is what I love most about this series . . . That, and some groundbreaking CG animation.I do wish the show didn't shy away from nudity so much, since it's almost entirely animated. Unfortunately, there probably are extra costs incurred from government restrictions and threats, and Hollywood guilds that charge for every nipple shown.The concepts are still interesting to watch, including the many comedic ones, which did make me laugh a lot. I still prefer the non-comedic episodes.\n",
            "What a great series. The first season is unbelievable just great stories of trial pain suffering and loss. The second season full short a little but I don't think it's done yet. The animation in both seasons is just stunning at points you can't even tell what's real and what's CGI. The stories are very well written and I hope this Continues Season after season. I give it a 9.5. Almost perfect. 1988.\n",
            "This is one of those series which Netflix gets rite. Short twisted tales with surprising climax.Season 1 was AWESOME.....Season 2 ...well not much, but it is still worth watching. I read reviews that the season 2 was so good and I kindoff disagree. It leaves you just craving enough for more. Can't wait for season 3.\n",
            "18 Standalone episodes. Some of them were too good. Some of them pretty good. None of them is below average.& since the episodes are not connected to each other, we don't have to worry about being divided into it. It's the reason why I haven't started many series. But this one is quite worth it.The only problem was, after 5 episodes or so, I felt that every episode contains some kind of plot twist. But most of them pulled it off quite well\n",
            "I'm so not interested in long drawn out series, why does everything have to turn into a soap opera. I love movies for the basic beginning middle and ENDING! These are super creative shorts that tell a storey or make a entertaining point without taking hours upon hours to do it.\n",
            "Excellent compilation of animated shorts, with a surprisingly wide range of stories and genres.Quality is the word that I think of to best describe this production. The animation is top notch, the episodes are very well written making you will feel entertained and especially engaged throughout the entirety of the season.Sure, some episodes are better than others depending on your personal taste, nonetheless the stories are so short and meaningful that is just a pleasure to watch. The themes are also extremely varied, episodes range from world dominating yogurt to self realizing robots.If you are a fan of animation or just looking for some good storytelling, this show is for you,\n",
            "Enjoy!\n",
            "As beautiful as the technology is, what a horrible way to spread fear and hate in the world, only makes me realise how much anger people have in their heartwhy not use that technology to spread light and positiveness?Of course everything is so well made, you basically cannot critique the beauty of the animation which is TOP but i cannot fathom how much despair and darkness is show trough these short animations.Im tired of seeing people use cgi only to convey pain and suffering, obviously there are better ways to use it.\n",
            "I love it. I love it. I love it.I'm just sad there's not more. That's literally all I came here to say.\n",
            "...I loved this series for the variety of styles and themes. My 2 fave eps,(..which I have revisited many times..),were 'Sonnies Edge' and 'Snow in the Desert',I felt that both these little vignettes crammed more excitement and pulse-pounding, visceral action into 18 minutes or so than almost any recent film I can think of. There were loads of off-beat humour and surreal stories sometimes quite horrific and nearly always thought provoking which I loved, add superb voice work,music and sound effects and really, you've got a winner in your hands. Like many others, I certainly hope they do some more....personally, I would love to see more of 'Sonnie' and Mr 'Snow' but I suspect we will not...shame, that.....\n",
            "Special I loved the chapter with Wolf, hope to see more chapters later and thank you in sessions.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots.A collection of short movies with different stories and different types that are mostly sci-fi and fantasy.My first impression about this series was a disappointment to be honest, then things turns to get more and more interesting, so it's not about the short movies or their stories actually, it's about the vibe that this show offers, those well animated short episodes were fascinating, the whole idea is great, it discusses the limits of a human's brain, the thing that animation can make it more realistic than a realistic show.My favorite ep was David Fincher's episode(Bad travelling)\n",
            "And I'm hungry for more.\n",
            "I may just not be a fan of short stories. Most of the time there's just not enough to get me invested. So for most of these episodes, my feeling was, \"meh.\" But there are a few I love.Lots of different animation styles. Lots of different ideas and concepts. I've rated each episode on it's page, but here is a summary for reference with a few notes for some.Season 1: 6 stars (2-3 viewings, 8/1/2023)Sonnie's Edge 9 stars. Oozes cool, gives me goosebumps. My favorite of the first 3 seasons.Three Robots 8 stars. Hilarious, I would watch a whole movie of this.The Witness 6 stars. Great animation. Story feels pointless.Suits 6 stars.Sucker of Souls 6 stars. Really cool but missing that oomph. I wanted it to keep going and was annoyed when it ended.When the Yogurt Took Over 6 stars. Pretty funny and interesting.Beyond the Aquila Rift 8 stars. I love this episode. And I immediately added the song Living in the Shadows to my music library.Good Hunting 6 stars.The Dump 5 stars. Eh. Not bad but feels pointless.Shape-Shifters 6 stars.Helping Hand 5 stars.Fish Night 3 stars. Really dumb.Lucky 13 - 4 stars. There just is nothing here. And while the animation style goes for realism, the flight scenes and explosions don't feel real.Zima Blue 4 stars.Blindspot 6 stars.Ice Age 6 stars.Alternate Histories 3 stars. I can't stand this animation style.The Secret War 4 stars.Season 2: 5 stars (1-2 viewings, 8/4/2023)Automated Customer Service 5 stars. Fairly amusing but I can't stand this animation style.Ice 6 stars. Visually stimulating.Pop Squad 4 stars.Snow in the Desert 5 stars.The Tall Grass 5 stars.All Through the House 3 stars.Life Hutch 6 stars.The Drowned Giant 2 stars. How can something 10 mins long be so boring. Also, what even is this? LolSeason 3: 7 stars (1 viewing, 8/12/2023)Three Robots - Exit Strategies 6 stars. The first one is my second favorite episode of LD+R. This one is amusing but didn't make me laugh nearly as much.Bad Travelling 8 stars. \"Directed by David Fincher.\" I was stunned. He's only my second favorite director ever. Of course it's him, this episode is amazing.The Very Pulse of the Machine 6 stars.Night of the Mini Dead 8 stars. So cool. Feels like an entire movie crammed into five minutes. So many events so fast.Kill Team Kill 8 stars. Hardcore awesomeness.Swarm 4 stars. I've seen this concept/message before too many times. I knew exactly what it was about from the beginning.Mason's Rats 5 stars.In Vaulted Halls Entombed 5 stars.Jibaro 7 stars. Perfect example of how you do a short story. Images are beautiful and stunning.\n",
            "I wish Netflix made more quality originals as this one.\n",
            "Great, original, & creative\n",
            "This animated anthology series is like someone took a blender, threw in a bunch of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror tropes, hit the puree button, and out popped this deliciously bizarre concoction. Each episode is a self-contained story, ranging from the downright absurd to the oddly profound. You've got everything from sentient yogurt taking over the world to werewolf soldiers fighting in a futuristic war. Yeah, it's that kind of wild ride.The animation styles vary from episode to episode, which keeps things interesting. One minute you're watching photorealistic humans, and the next, you're knee-deep in some trippy, neon-drenched fever dream. It's like a visual buffet, but how about the stories? Some are clever, some are downright weird, and a few might leave you scratching your head wondering what just happened. But that's part of the charm. It's like they took all the craziest ideas from a sci-fi convention and brought them to life on screen.Love, Death & Robots isn't for the faint of heart. There's violence, nudity, and enough F-bombs to make a sailor blush. But if you can handle a little animated anarchy, you're in for a treat. It's weird, it's wild, and it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you're into offbeat animation and stories that push the boundaries of what's possible.\n",
            "Unless some people get slapped in the face they don't know they've been hit. While I wish there were more episodes in season 2 what we get is deeply nuanced raising thoughts provoking questions about who we are and where we are heading, beautifully realised in CG. Pure art!\n",
            "While the animation and CGI are consistently entertaining and at times impressive, the story quality and acting vary widely in this anthology series. At times I was reminded of reading issues of HEAVY METAL magazine and SLOW DEATH underground comics back in the day with its mix of sci-fi-infused sex, violence, and gore. Except now, production values are substantially enhanced via modern CGI and technology.My favorite episodes: SUITS, GOOD HUNTING, ZIMA BLUE, and ALTERNATE HISTORIES. Otherwise, the quality varies with violence and gore substituting for story and characterization.If you are like me a big fan of sci-fi animation as I am you know that if you spend enough time cruising VIMEO and YOUTUBE you can discover a lot of really clever and imaginative sci-fi and fantasy short films. What Love, Death & Robots does is put together a bunch in an easily binge-able collection. Still, I must admit my interest in endless chases and gratuitous violence and cruelty has diminished over the years. Nowadays my interests are more attuned to creativity, cleverness, humor, and characterization.\n",
            "I like Love, Death & Robots - the show reminds me fondly of those comic sci-fi and fantasy anthologies or mags like Heavy Metal that I read in my younger days. And yes, not every episode is phenomenal but some are really good, and almost every story is based on some good idea, sometimes even unique, and some twists in the end are just too delicious - the animations are mostly eye candy too. No doubt, interesting for every lover of sci-fi, fantasy and the art of horror, and the short episodes make it a quick and well tasting snack in between.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots has given us many striking stories, but none reach the poetic, philosophical heights of Zima Blue. This episode transcends animation, becoming a deeply human meditation on purpose, identity, and the search for meaning.The way it unfolds, peeling back the layers of the Artist's journey, is nothing short of poetic perfection. That line-\"un-making myself... leaving just enough to appreciate my surroundings...\"-hits like an existential gut punch. It's so pure, so deeply human.Each moment adds depth to the story, culminating in a realization that touches on the profound beauty of simplicity and the origins of one's existence.It's story about the essence of life itself. Zima Blue reminds us that even in a world of endless complexity, there is profound beauty in simplicity and a sense of purpose in knowing who we truly are.It's one of those rare stories where the ending lingers in your mind like an echo, refusing to let go.Hats off.\n",
            "An amazing and diverse anthology with many memorable episodes. They are not connected in any way. Everything is done exclusively for each episode, but this doesn't make it any worse. Rather, on the contrary, this makes them even more colorful and exciting.Another advantage of this series is that if you are a cinema nerd, then you will obviously get much more emotions than the average viewer, since there are enough references in each episode. Every episode was made with tons of passion and talent.In some instances, the animation is simply divine! Some episodes look so realistic that often it feels like you're watching a movie with real actors? Everything is so clear and colorful. This and Arcane gives rise to a completely logical idea that Netflix in the near future may begin to develop a new direction in the animation industry. Or has it already begun?Love, Death & Robots is an amazing series. These are not only mini stories with beautiful visuals. It cannot be called simply entertaining. It touches on a lot of important topics and things. Each episode provides certain information that is worth thinking about.\n",
            "I guess the idea for each episode a story is good. It is true that stories are short and full of violence, but you can understand the meaning and purpose with ease\n",
            "If you're about to watch it for the first time, start with season 2, so you engage in beautiful animation and a nice concept, reminiscing of Black Mirror. Once you feel intrigued by it, go to season 1 and be prepared to be amazed.Season 2 deserves maybe a 3 star rating in my book, due to its wonderful animation and detail, but solely a 3 because its lack of engagement and complexity. I gave it still a 9 stars because season 1 was absolutely incredible... Magical.\n",
            "Very good works, different styles, varied themes, different techniques but all of them very well done. Congratulations to this compilation of works, without a doubt you have to see it.\n",
            "I just can't get enough of it. Absolutely loved it. Every episode is different that's why I never got bored of it. I'm in just awe of animation and production design. I'm so glad I didn't skip this show. There are definitely some episodes where I couldn't find any meaning behind it and left me in confusion but it's all worth it. One of the most innovative show of all time. There are some stories which are so creative and thought-provoking. Shout out to all the animators, writers, directors who put all their efforts to make this possible. I never thought of that some of animations in this show is even possible. It really showed the potential of cinema and the animation. Incredible!\n",
            "This show gave me huge black mirror vibes.\n",
            "Animation is incredible, a variety of different styles but excelling at all.\n",
            "Some very gory stories, some very explicit but all very well done.\n",
            "Each episode is short so every scene, shot and detail is important for the story line.\n",
            "The stories are unique each episode, the animation alternates, and the episodes are short and fast paced. I found the content different and enjoyable. There isn't much adult content like this on Netflix, but I hope they add more.\n",
            "It is the best animated series I have ever seen. I'm in binge watched in one day and I'm loved it. I wish I could rate it 11. If this gets below 9 average, that'd be unfair.\n",
            "This is a great series one you start you won't stop!! Very original and amazing graphics\n",
            "If every woke series/movie was done like this i would not have so much problems with them.\n",
            "Entertaining to the last, dark, brutal, honest! Quite the show, did not expect it to be this good.\n",
            "For the most part I like these shorts a lot; they have great stories, some that could make cool movies. My disappointment was with the insane amount of nudity and sexuality in them. Most of these stories could have been told without the need to make most of the women lesbians and everyone getting naked.\n",
            "Haven't watched anything original like this for a while, every episode has its own charm and atmosphere, complementing with unique storylines. Things like this must be considered as piece of art! Highly recommend to check it out.\n",
            "All the animations are put together well. The stories are individual and unique, leaving you wanting more.The only problem is most of the stories are objectifying women... lots of scenes of naked females and potential rape, sometimes glorifying it, which is disappointing and unnecessary.The stories themselves are original, and could have been more.An interesting move by Netflix, but as stated, women in a larger majority of the shorts, do not need to be objectified.Women watch and enjoy animation too.Make sure the next series has more equality for women, portraying us more than just objects of sexual immature male fantasies.Grow up guys!!\n",
            "Lots of impressive animation and gratuitous sex and violence. The only bad thing I have to say is that the first short was the best short. I enjoyed the rest of them regardless of this.\n",
            "Loved it, watched all episodes in one sitting, the stories and animation styles are in the same vein as a favourite movie of mine from long ago...Heavy Metal.\n",
            "In most movies/TV series, they have 1-2 great ideas but try to make 8-12 episodes with 4-5 seasons or make a 2 hour boring movie with 20 min great story. However, I was really happily surprised.The season 1 has 18 episodes with mostly sci-fi and sometimes drama or somewhat dystopic themes and each episode is 5-10 min short but really well to the point. I was better touched in most episodes of season 1 than what other sci-fi or drama artworks try to embrace and bore in 2 hours.Additionally, in most artworks, we see 1-2 great episodes (1-2 great parts in those 1-2 episodes). However, all the episodes have been unique and great.Since episodes are really short, we cannot talk much about the characters but I could still feel for the characters because the emotions were well portrayed and mostly sad but there are happy endings, too . I was especally amazed by episode 7, 8, 14. I anticipated most of the endings but this also shows how well the episodes has been prepared.Also, the episodes are not with the same visual techniques each different technique is also well suited for the contents of the episode.Finally, I want to thank everyone who made me watch this great show.PS: Most episodes also somewhat reminded me of Black Mirror by putting a mirror to us/humans.\n",
            "The show is a beautiful jorney into multiple dimensions of love, technology and DEATH\n",
            "The first episode was amazing, they should do a whole series based on that chapter...\n",
            "One of the best Netflix series...\n",
            "Great animation, stories, and uniqueness. About time Netflix put something good on again.\n",
            "Season one was good. I personally think season two was a contest to see who could produce the most mind numbing pile of excrement.\n",
            "Love - check.\n",
            "Death - bloody check.\n",
            "Robots - BIG METAL CHECK.\n",
            "Absolutely recommend it. I'm surprised how VFX gone far.\n",
            "Based on the limited marketing that had leeched into my infosphere, I had semi-consciously written off Robots as yet another low-sheen manga snoozefest. Yesterday I pushed past my ingrained resistance and actually clicked on the title. What I saw there caught my attention, something which I was not in the slightest expecting. Seeing that my total commitment to an initial taste-test would be in the range of 10 minutes, I decided to take the plunge.Wow! I was instantly immersed in a compelling 3D world that evoked some of my favourite sci-fi imagery and ideas, with a satisfying, elegant narrative wrapped in gorgeous visuals made with exceptional love and stellar production values. Robots is deeply engaging, delivering innovative and playful twists on familiar sci-fi tropes, cutting new and interesting ground in hybrid animation and visual style. What a reminder, yet again, to never make assumptions about a Netflix-ordered production. Whilst not every episode was to my taste, the great majority were awesomely good, and I had to restrain myself to leave at least a few episode-morsels to savour at a later time. Props, Netflix & co for plastering a silly, satisfied grin on my face.\n",
            "Very mature and enjoyable shorts. It's like the shorts at the beginning of Disney movies except R rated. It somehow draws you in and gives you an amazing story in less than 30 minutes. Highly recommend.\n",
            "It's been a while since I sat staring at the screen in awe after watching a series or movie on Netflix (or TV for that matter). I did when I watched the first few episodes of Love, Death & Robots on Netflix. A nice plot twist, that was also well executed made me say \"Wow!\" out loud.The plots are nice and good in almost all of these short stories. The art style is suburb and direction and cutting is top notch. I like the voice acting and the way characters are displayed and developed, even in the short time the individual series have (10 to 15 minutes).The only negative, perhaps, is the amount of gore. Sometimes this is a tad too much for my taste, but after the first few episodes I knew what to expect. But it's still something to be prepared for if you start watching these.Recommended!\n",
            "At first I didn't Know what I was hoping for but boy oh boy. Once I started I couldn't stop my self. Stories are short around 10-15 minutes but every single episode is so intriguing so creative that at the end of each episode you want to tell all your friends how awesome this is..\n",
            "Whoever came up with the stories... really hats off to the guy. Really amazing series.\n",
            "Hope there'll be a second season of this.\n",
            "I was really looking forward to a new season as the first one really blew me away. It's always a pleasent surprise to see new episodes are in. Half way in to S03 EP01 though I got really nauseous of all the political refrences. When it came to Mars and the behavior of the wealthy I felt myself in a DNC conference. I would have prefered something more scifi and less political.If you are being political atleast don't be this far left. It just proves the critics that Netflix has a woke mind virus as so many of the Tech companies.\n",
            "I really enjoyed this series. Started watching and had to see all episodes. Really good and I hope to see more series like this in the future.\n",
            "I saw the titte in netflix and i thought it was another sitcom series and saw the trailer.... i was stupified by the amount of different animations and wanted to give it a try. Simply and utterly WoW and mindblown. Each episode has its own team of animators and story.\n",
            "This could easily be called the Black Mirror of animation.\n",
            "Each and every story has its own twisted plot in which you end up amazed by the quality and jawdropped work of the team behnd it.\n",
            "its been just a day since it streamed in netflix and i ve already shared to my whole list of friends like crazy.\n",
            "I gladly recomended it\n",
            "So good I actually made my first imdb review. Need more. Won't overdescribe it.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots is deep, artistic, well written and influential 18 short stories. The series can be perceived as 18 pilots for new series. Of course, few episodes fall flat, but there is something for every taste. The gathering of that number of incredibly talented animators and writers and showcasing them in such an intense production is a bold, daring, and game changing move by Netflix.\n",
            "This series took me on quite a mind trip. It leaves you wanting more. Its visualy stunning and stands out.\n",
            "I knew nothing going into the show, and it completely blew me away. When I started watching, I got a very familiar 'Animatrix'-vibe from it, and I enjoyed the ride of the first episode so much, that I binge watched the entire season the same day. Fantastic art styles, animation and great storytelling. Some episodes stood stronger than others of course, but I enjoyed every second and I hope I get a chance to see more.\n",
            "One of the most entertaining experiences I've had on Netflix for a while! 10/10\n",
            "Wild ride of stories, each one unexpected. Beautiful visuals too. Want to see more like this.. maybe even a series or movie about Sonnie's Edge or 3 Robots\n",
            "Well...every where we see movies with love,action, comedy, sci-fi, but Netflix be like okay make some badass bloody,dark,humour, confusing , Horror type movies but not with Real people buy animated people....not so long story but episode type story...and boooooom here you go... Behold the awesomeness....just watch and enjoy....\n",
            "The stories! The animation! It is truly an amazing visual spectacle, each episode is unique, raw and fascinating. It is one of the few series on streaming I will rewatch over and over, still finding cool details. Great Job Netflix.\n",
            "Just a show that take syfy to the next level.\n",
            "short episods that gos right to the point.\n",
            "its like thay made a syfy movie and cut all the boring parts and left you with the best sean and still maneged to tell a hole story.\n",
            "They really need to make the first episode feature length. The series gets a 7 from me just based on that, the other stories are interesting, some better than others but there's something for everyone.\n",
            "One of netflixs best shows amazing shorts most of which are superb a great show in so many genres Sci fi horror fantasy and comedy a real recommendation for a binge worthy fix\n",
            "I just happened to see this title and saw it was an animation, which I love. So I gave it a shot.\n",
            "After the first episode I was hooked. The animation of every story is unreal. So many cool story's, fast paced, action, thriller, suspense... I mean, I felt like I took an adrenaline shot, I didn't want to stop. I literally binge watch the whole thing.One of the best things about the show is the variety of artistic creativity. The shows come from all different angles of scifi. With each episode you know that they are not going to show the same story twice. Amazing produced and well written this is something for all scifi lovers.Parents, this is not a Kids show. Very adult themes and violence. I don't mind violence. I think they keep it true what they were trying to portray. Listen they all can't be Frozen. Adult animation is huge. I wouldn't change a thing.If Netflix's doesn't make a 2nd season, well lets just say I think that would be stupid. But no matter what, I will always have this season which I plan on rewatching, TODAY.WEll done Netflixs and Love Death Robots. AMAZING SHOW, ONE OF THE BEST IVE SEEN IN YEARS.\n",
            "These short films are incredible, there's nothing more to it. I've watched half of this season of anthology short films and I can't wait to watch the rest of them.The shorts are incredibly detailed in its animations. The stories in each of the shorts are great, weird, horrific in a good way, and hilarious. I'd say that episode 6, 'When The Yogurt Took Over', is my favorite out of every episode that I've seen, because it's so outrageous that it's brilliant. Episode 8 is also a favorite of mine, and I would actually love to see more of that story because it's an incredibly cool concept. The animation in that episode is a solid 10/10.I'd recommend this to anyone who loves great stories, great animation (both 2D as well as 3D), and to anyone who doesn't have time to bingewatch an entire 22-episode, 45-minute season.\n",
            "The Animations are just awesome........ Netflix comes out with something fabulous all the time! Just like black mirror no two episodes are inter linked or have any continuity with each other.\n",
            "Gore scenes and Nudity are sort of a given, and due to it's very short duration (7-14 minutes max) every episode feels like a movie climax scene.....\n",
            "Few episodes weren't actually as good as others but from 10th episode it went crazy\n",
            "Literally loved it...\n",
            "Binge watch it (Recommended)\n",
            "I would give this a rating of 8.5/10\n",
            "I loved the animation style of many of the episodes in this series. Some of the stories were interesting. Some strange and seemingly pointless like The Witness. I loved the Good Hunting episode. I also appreciated the elements of hypersexuality and over the top violence, which we just don't get enough of in current mainstream media. Thank you Netflix.\n",
            "What an unexpected surprise.... Wow!!!\n",
            "Bless you, Netflix and thx for this work of art.\n",
            "My review rating is based on the average of all episodes. Honestly, the better ones outnumber the bad ones. There overall tone of the show reminds me a lot of the animatrix. Technology has advanced quite a lot since then and you can see it easily. However technology does not necessary mean good story which is evident in certain episodes. In any case I'm looking forward to the next season. I'm sure there will be new and really pleasant surprises. Not sure if many people mentioned it but for me the voice talent they picked is amazing. I recognize some voices from different shows, games from years ago. That's quite something.\n",
            "In conclusion I only wish some episodes were at least 20 minutes longer. I know there's plenty to be told in 10 but it's not worth making rushed conclusions just to fit the timing. There were more bad endings than good just for that reason alone.\n",
            "Favorutes:Beyond the Aquila Rift, Zima Blue, The secret war, Sonnie's edge.\n",
            "There are others totally skippable, but you'll be the judge of that.\n",
            "This is exceptionally clever, unique stories with some flawless animations couldn't leave my couch once I hit the play button ,Don't have any words to praise the last episode.\n",
            "Kudos to Netflix and everyone associated with it.\n",
            "This show will blow you away. The story telling, the animation style, design, music....its like nothing else I've see. You must see it.\n",
            "This is going right on top of my favorite hard sci fi shows with westworld, black mirror and battlestar galactosica (sorry the yogurt took over).\n",
            "Finally something that sound like real science fiction to me.\n",
            "It has been around 70 years that directors and big productors readapt the same sf ideas every year or about. Avengers being one of the latest un-science-fiction possible movie, where the universe works with 19th century laws/models of cosmology (Luminiferous aether). Even the next biggest real production ever, what everybody is waiting for, Dune from Villeneuve, is another 70's classic that never reached its original vision on screen, yet.\n",
            "I was stunt watching those short films. This is the new science fiction.\n",
            "\"Beyond the Aquila Rift\" is by itself a masterpiece. It managed to reach that sense of unjustified fear of the unknown that AC Clarke told so much about. The sense of going from an aquarium to ocean, at a biological level. I could talk for hours about this one and I am pretty sure we could do the same for each of the others.\n",
            "Must see.\n",
            "It's one of the best shows I've seen on Netflix in a while. If you're doubting, DON'T! Each episode runs less than 20 minutes, and each are so unique in their own ways. PLEASE BRING ON THE NEXT SEASON!\n",
            "If, like me, you like your sci-fi intelligent and quirky rather than generic and lazy you must try Love, Death & Robots! Just found this Netflix David Fincher series this morning by accident and despite the sun being out I suspect I'm not going to get much done this morning! Please give it a go. Just one responsible bit of caution. Despite being animation it's not for youngsters or those of a delicate constitution! Enjoy.\n",
            "Had watched the first season a month before , 2years after the 1st season released . Was too late but had already regretted of not watching it earlier . Today I had finished the 2nd season and I have no words to say , could have had more episodes tho . Nevertheless this show never fails to impress me and it is definitely a must watch .\n",
            "I went into this expecting something along the lines of short-form 'Black Mirror', but what I actually got was 'Heavy Metal' 2019 (at least for the most part). This collection of shorts is filled to the brim with violence, nudity and B-Movie narratives. Some episodes know how to pull this off in a charming way (Sucker of Souls, Three Robots, Suits), while others take themselves so seriously, that the subpar writing turns from endearing to embarrassing (Aquila Rift, Sonnie's Edge, Shape-Shifters).There is an inherent charm to the whole thing, once you accept that it's basically exploitation-trash. Violence and sex are shown for the sake of it, and I believe that's perfectly fine, if you don't pretend to be more than that. But, when one of the 'deeper' episodes (Aquila Rift) interrupts its brief story for a minute-long softcore scene, I rolled my eyes a bit. In combination with its Uncanny Valley-like animation, I had bad flashbacks to the awkward sex-scenes in Mass Effect.And then, there are the outliers like 'Zima Blue', 'Fish Night', 'When the Yogurt Took Over', which were more akin to the kind of shorts I was expecting before going in. These aren't necessarily more intriguing than their trashier counter-parts, but they still stick out.Most of the shorts simply lack a certain punchline or interesting idea that you could only truly realize in this specific format. A lot of them feel either aimless, or like boiled-down action movies. The one that really got it right was 'Helping Hand'. You have a simple set-up and a smart conclusion that fits the theme of the show. It doesn't overstay its welcome, and it doesn't try to emulate long-form movies. It's an idea that works best for a short-film.Apart from the 'lifelike' art-style (which, unfortunately, is used rather often), I really enjoyed the animation. Some favorites are 'The Witness', 'Sucker of Souls' and 'Good Hunting'.The show can be trashy fun, with short bursts of more subtle ideas. But if you were expecting something with a little more substance, you will be disappointed.\n",
            "This makes up for the crap so far. Was an absolutely awesome series. Not even close to what I expected. I thought it couldn't get any better that the yogurt episode but by golly it did and then some. Netflix needs to build on this and make it a franchise. Who wrote this stuff? If was mind blowing, original and will be very difficult to better. But send us some more anyway. I loved the Afghanistan episode. Wow, just wow.\n",
            "I was entranced by this series. Every episode is a wildly different story with wildly different animation styles. Always interesting, looks great, sounds great, is great. The only thing I have bad to say about it is that they need to chill on the political commentary. We are here to be entertained, not \"educated.\"\n",
            "While certainly a challenge, it must be like a dream to work with the people who created this very special work of art. I don't think it's possible for anyone to enjoy more than me.\n",
            "It is probably my favorite series of all time. What a fkn masterpiece. Haven't watched everything cuz there are literally 18 episodes of this madness. Couldn't recommend it enough. Just watch it damn it\n",
            "It's very free, and creative. I like how each episode is different, and switches up the formula from other TV series. Very intereeeeeee eeeeeesting.\n",
            "For me personally, I couldn't ask for a more entertaining, well-animated and neatly written series than this right now. It just popped into existence right when I didn't know I needed it the most.It's sort of dark at times, but always with a light, happy-go-lucky touch to justify some of the (arguably) oversaturated violence and gore. I loved it, but I can see certain people not enjoyimg it as much.If you love sci-fi, you're going to want to watch Love, Death + Robots.\n",
            "Many stories, many plots, definitely one big Netflix original show, this show must he one of the reasons to keep paying Netflix, I want a season 2\n",
            "Spectacular! One of the best tv series in years! Hope they will make at least 12 seasons!\n",
            "JUST WATCHH!!!!! FASTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "This anthology is made of pure passion. Its product of fascinating brain and imagination.\n",
            "Every episode brings something awesome to this party of a series\n",
            "Probably the best of Netflix to be released this year and these 18 short stories with an amazing Animation Effects and brilliance in story concept is an eye-catcher. Except for couple of Episodes, the other were brutal, fascinating as well as backed by brilliant writing. This is a must watch, even though it may be highly explicit and filled with nudity.\n",
            "Wow, Wow, and Wow!! These stories are amazing! I am not typically into animated stuff but figured I'd watch an episode because they're so short. Now I can't stop watching. Each one is brilliant. Of course, some I like more than others (Lucky 13 & Three Robots), but all of them have caused a strong reaction or emotional response. Like with Helping Hand I had to watch through my fingers. That was intense, made all the more so because of how good the animation was. At times I wondered if it really was animation.\n",
            "So if you're like me and not too into animation, just give one or two episodes a try, I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n",
            "I don't know if anyone said it, but some episodes (ideas) must have a movie or series it's own. This is art my friends and I'm not exaggerating.\n",
            "I love it. Give them an oscar ...... better two....... or three\n",
            "I love it Netflix must produce more shows like this\n",
            "Heavy metal 2019. Glad the genre is back. But better than it was in the 80's.\n",
            "I went in not really knowing what this was about , I was so amazingly surprised how much I feel in love with it. The stories are great and the graphics are even better . Absolutely watch this ! Watch it ASAP!\n",
            "Extremely strong last episode with mythical motives! The river lady called \"Samodiva\" played the perfect role! The bulgarian folklore song vocal was amazing!\n",
            "SEASON 1: Took me forever to finally come around to watch this show and I gotta say- I like the short anthological episodes a lot more than I expected! The concepts of most of the shorts are super intriguing however I did not enjoy the excessive use of nudity (often without importance to the plot) especially when it was super sexualized. Looking forward to the other seasons as I heard they toned it down there. Most Favorite Episode: Sonnie's Edge // Least Favorite Episode: Sucker of SoulsSEASON 2: Watching this one day after finishing the first season I really appreciated the lack of nudity. The stories and concepts however felt more shallow and less intriguing than the first season. Most Favorite Episode: Snow in the Desert // Least Favorite Episode: IceSEASON 3: Writing this review a week after finishing the season and I can say that it was better than the second but season 1 was BY FAR the best one. Again, entertaining, and intriguing concepts with astonishing graphics. Most Favorite Episode: Three Robots (Exit Strategies) // Least Favorite Episode: Bad Travelling.\n",
            "I just went through a mind blowing animation ecstasy. I think they were creative masterpieces of visuals and animations, sound and script. I am overjoyed. I can't help but sign in and leave a review for the series. I am a fan!\n",
            "Before I begin I would suggest watching it backwards as the beginning is more densely populated with \"strong\" episodes.That said Initially I wanted to give it 9 stars but the episodes are so heterogenous and appeal to the fans of hard sci-fi, cyberpunk, people superficially acquainted with japanese folklore, modern pop culture feats and many more. The graphics are 3D,2D 2,5D and whatever other D you can percept without using bulky accessories. The series deserve to be ranked as outstanding even though every episode spans no longer than 15 mins and varies in appeal to different audiences. If there is Season 2 I hope it won't lose the twist the series possess though I can't see how can it surprise the viewer any more it already had.\n",
            "Every episode is different and it's amazing! I love how easy it is too watch.\n",
            "The art, the stories, the deeper concepts presented are glorious! I recommend this to everyone (over 18 of course) and i really hope we see a season 2!\n",
            "Thanks god for such brilliant works that created by talented Miller and Fincher.\n",
            "Most of them are really amazing and everybody should watch them and judge them for themselves and this is a journey to surrealism and hidden era of human soul and nature.\n",
            "Trust me, you will watch this show in one day! Its so good.\n",
            "From the moment I turned it o. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The animation is perfect. Different styles. I loved the animation in episode 3 keep em coming please\n",
            "One second into the first season you immediately get your generic Netflix 'girl power' vibes, 'let's yell at the generic antagonized white male and automatically win everything because muh feminism'.Waste of resources, but because the animation is pretty awesome and it's violent everyone will love it without thinking twice about how cliche it is for Netflix, how senseless the 'plot' is and how it has nothing new or original to offer.It's like a bootleg ABC's of Death but with a way bigger budget and taking itself way too seriously. As always when it comes to Netflix, I knew exactly what to expect and I wasn't pleasantly surprised to see anything new.If you're desperate to watch \"strong\" female characters with either the Skrillex haircut or no hair at all kill \"evil\" white men in countless different scenarios, and scenes featuring lots of tits and dicks, the dicks often being shot at or damaged because (???) -- make your own conclusions what the agendas are here. As usual Netflix is waging a war against men in general, but I did enjoy two of the 18 episodes because they happened to not be SJW trash.\n",
            "Most of the episodes are nearly brilliant. In both manners, animation and storytelling. The short movies manage to tell great stories and even develop great characters. Can't hardly wait for new episodes and freakish ideas.\n",
            "This stuff is awesome. Every episode is very good watch in any order you want\n",
            "These Are best of science fiction And fantasy short short.stories in tv. Some have so much potential that MY only regret is they are not made into full feature movies. Secret war is my favourite.\n",
            "Normally I wouldn't be cool with people calling something classic/masterpiece so soon after it releases. But in this case I absolutely agree. This will be the benchmark for every animated project that will come out in the future.\n",
            "SHEESH these robots are crazy.The fun anthology series returned with a second season. Similar to the first season, each episode has different animation, for the most part, and only one episode wasn't animated. Even though it's not thought-provoking and rich in themes like Black Mirror, I still love this series for its entertainment.And this second season wasn't different, as I enjoyed most of the episodes. The best episodes were the ones that had horror elements. They were adrenaline-inducing and intense in such a short amount of time. There was one episode that wasn't intense at all, and was more nonchalant and philosophical than the rest. This was my least favorite episode, as I found it weird and boring.Overall, the second season mostly gave me what I loved about the first season. Very entertaining. 8.5/10.\n",
            "All of my favourite genres in one series. Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Dark Comedy, Horror.The graphics are excellent, the stories are dark, and I am already waiting for the second season.This is the best animated anthology I've ever seen.. David Fincher and Tim Miller are my new demi-gods.\n",
            "I was anticipating this since the time the rumours were out. Was not disappointed, but not excited either with season 1 (plenty of good episodes though to forget the lame ones). Second season was not good, almost bad. Lost my interest. When the third season aired, I was so pleasantly surprised. 4th season please!Season 1 : 7/10 some episodes very good, some not so, some good but very dated 80s-90s\n",
            "cliches\n",
            "Season 2 : 5/10 almost all episodes were either boring or lazy written, animation levels great\n",
            "at most episodes\n",
            "Season 3 : 8/10 keep it up like this! Fresh and amusing. Needed more episodes, like those,\n",
            "this season.\n",
            "A joy to watch!!! Don' t miss this show!\n",
            "Thanks Netflix!\n",
            "Every episode was super intriguing and well animated. I wish they'd turn them all into full shows. Really good, one of the best series they've made so far.My only complaint is that there isn't more and they're so short I watched them all in a few hours.\n",
            "This is by far one of THE most captivating series of short animations I have watched. Aesthetic, and flawless. Hope twenty more seasons will come out; most certainly there are more number of brilliant writers out there to be discovered to contribute to such plethora of traumatizingly beautiful pieces.\n",
            "Must watch. Gripping stories. Engaging dialogues. Breath taking vfx and Graphics. Outstanding production design. Sharp lightning.\n",
            "There is a surprise in each story\n",
            "Loved this, very original and great stories. Dark, funny, ticks all the boxes!\n",

            "I think everyone should see these brilliant episodes.\n",
            "If Netflix would excist merely with content like this and nothing else, I would pay even more every month and smile every time i do so. Bravo!\n",
            "Netflix have a lot of c**p. BUT THIS. With this one they did it. For the fans of Black Mirror. This is worth watching, with every episode different from the last. Most of them shows how and where humanity is going with technology, narrated in a fun way with outstanding graphics. Can wait to see more. Also, nice touch with the sounds in the intro...but Black Mirror did it first.\n",
            "I loved every one of these short films. Beautiful animation and excellent storytelling and in parts absolutely insane. I watched the whole series in one sitting. Cant wait for next series. Probably one the the few shows on Netflix I will sit through again it was that brilliant.\n",
            "I have to say that I am a fan of the genre, and I would love to see more animation movies out there but I would never ever imagined to see such a masterpiece of a series on Netflix.\n",
            "The quality of the animations, the richness of the lore, the amazing plot twist and the variety of genre made every episode a unique adventure in a different reality.\n",
            "It could be very violent in some parts, but is because this series has no filter and I'm completely happy with that.\n",
            "The only negative side is the duration of each episodes and especially for some of just 6-8 minutes is not enough to completely enjoy them, and the sadness for being separated from that story is a lot.\n",
            "Also some stories are not that great but the astonishing quality compensate for it.This series is in another league together with Black Mirror. And I hope Netflix will do a lot of seasons because these masterpiece are never enough (and I hope to see more from some episodes).\n",
            "Ok, I am on 4th episode now and let me tell you, each episode will make you feel all kinds of different emotions! This is incredibly well made. Don't rush it, though,or do rush it...whatever. I'll miss it when I'm finished watching. That's the only regret!Futuristic mind-blower. Yay! Thanks Netflix for this recommendation.\n",
            "It's bold, beautiful, gritty, nasty and creepy in some places.It got it all: Monsters, robots, vampires, hell in space, cats, ghost dinos, boobs, aliens, soldier werewolfs and so on.\n",
            "Some of the best animation I have ever seen. Competes for a top spot in the best Netflix Original. Incredible storytelling keeps you intrigued through every 15 min show.\n",
            "Just amazing. The show is beautiful and each of the stories stand on their own two feet. Really well done and I hope there's a season two\n",
            "Overall I love that Netflix is doing this and opening up an avenue for new voices, new stories/styles and more than anything pushing adult focused animation. The industry has needed this for decades.Unfortunately a number of the shows fall into the same old misogynistic tropes of rape as a plot device. The episodes that rely on this didn't need them as central devices or character motivation... any of 100 other origin stories could have worked and would not have lessened the story or execution of it.I'm hopeful that there is a Season 2 and that in that season they stay away from these plot devices and depictions of woman. The genre doesn't need it, the industry should be past these type of stories and it is so much more than that.All of that being said the series is definitely worth the wait, definitely worth watching. My personal favorites (in order) are:Zima Blue\n",
            "Suits\n",
            "Sucker of Souls\n",
            "Alternate Histories\n",
            "Helping Hand\n",
            "Blind Spot\n",
            "Shape Shifters\n",
            "This is truly a masterpiece, if i have ever seen one...All episodes tell a complete story, the episodes are perfect in length, there is no \"filler\" content, everything is just right.... The casting, the voices, the plot, the script, the execution, it's a very commendable effort....This is a must-see if you're a fan of the science fiction genre...\n",
            "I honestly can not do this justice in my review but if i can tell you anything it is to watch it!!.\n",
            "For such short anthology episodes it grips you instantly you feel some kind of bond to the charachters very fast at it leaves you wanting full feature films from each one .\n",
            "The minds behind this are nothing short of amazing from dialogue to the graphics and vibe each episode gives you cant wait for more !\n",
            "Few episodes in i must say I'm impressed. The best thing was that i was completely into it. It kept me intrigued. Good job netflix.\n",
            "Some of the episodes are pretty good. Some aren't so good. But overall if you like anthologies geared towards fantasy, horror, and science fiction this series is OK.It's a little like the YouTube channels ALTER, Omeleto, and DUST. These YouTube channels post independent filmmakers' content, and offer a lot of short format stories. So if you like Love, Death & Robots you might check them out.In some of the episodes in Love, Death & Robots the writers lay on the social and political commentary pretty thick. But hey, writers have been doing that for a long time. They also overrepresent women and minorities in their character selection and while I wouldn't say that doing so distracts from the episodes, it's very obvious what they are doing. But again, it's par for the course these days. So it is what it is.If you're triggered by seeing more minority and female characters, much fewer white males, or don't care for left leaning politics you might find some of the episodes to be turn off. But I say just grin and bear it. Each episode is a self-contained story, and they're all pretty short. So if you stumble on an episode you don't like don't worry the ride isn't long.\n",
            "Haven't seen anything this good for years. That's says it all. Must seen for si fi fans.\n",
            "All the different genres, with amazing futuristic and fantastical story lines. Short episodes with quality ranging from old cartoons to high-end cgi makes it the perfect series for anyone. It doesn't bore you. Every episode is a surprise. I really recommend this show.\n",
            "I never leave reviews but this show.... I had to.\n",
            "Netflix really did it this time. Every episode in the series could actually get it's own show and be great some even phenomenal. Personally my favorite is SHAPE-SHIFTERS and SONNIE'S EDGE. The animation used is also on another level. This show is a top of the line series that hopefully gets more and more seasons. I hope everyone enjoys!\n",
            "Trust me no matter what you are into, this show will not disappoint!\n",
            "Sit back, relax and enjoy this masterpiece!\n",
            "Absolutely love this, so pure and beautiful! The C.G.I. was the best I EVER seen. Every episode is in a different style of anime. From cartoon to tech to magma, It's just stunning! When it's over you wish there was just so much more every episode can possibly be it's own series a few in particular. Even if your not into anime everyone can find something they will just love in this series. I will warn you thought some episodes get really graphic. Which is awesome actually.\n",
            "Just stumbled across this so far watch 5 story's that interested me wasn't disappointed animation was astounding. It's like animated black mirror series.\n",
            "The only drawback is they're too short not leaving enough time for a fuller story. But the graphics and acting are top notch. Netflix has a winner here. If they have a second season I'd vote for a shorter 10 episode 30 minutes per season.\n",
            "If you really love series like Black Mirror, then this is the one for you. Keeps you at the edge of the seat just with 10-15 minute stories.\n",
            "The best part about the series is the making and editing of each episode which is just spectacular in every way. The violence really terrifies you sometimes.\n",
            "But hey.. Don't expect to see the typical movie elements like - introduction of characters followed by story elevation and then finally a climax. You don't see all of that in here.. Just enjoy those 10-15 minutes without looking for meaning.. The best episode for me is \"Sonnie's Edge\". Looking forward to see a few more episodes.\n",
            "Amazing animation. Amazing writing. Amazing everything. I feel like this series was tailor-made for me. Especially the creature features. I binged it non-stop and then made my friends do the same. Thank you!\n",
            "Well It offer something new certainly. I really like the video game cutscene vibe. Not all episodes are breathtaking though.\n",
            "Simply great. Every History leaves you with something to dwell on in deep thoughts. I didnt sleep watching the whole thing and could aftewards, Just thinking. Very powerful stuff.\n",
            "This is like the Anime Adaptation of Black Mirror. At first I was skeptical about the animation series but it's better than my expectation. The unexpected twist and turns makes us so anticipated. I loved it.\n",
            "This anthology is spectacular. The whole thing is like a series of cut scenes from some sci-fi video games. I'm a gamer so I appreciate the visual splendor, abstract concepts, and immaculate CGI. It really is beautifully done. Netflix never disappoint. This is without a doubt one of their best ever.\n",
            "Short films are probably my favourite type of film. They're really the very essence of a story, stripped off of anything that is not essential, and it is because they are so condensed that they will leave you feeling very intensely about whatever is told.To me, this anthology, however, was a very nice animation around a whole lot of nothing, really. In general, the plots were very shallow, predictable and most of them made me feel like they didn't even have a proper ending! And I'm all for open endings, but I'm talking about no ending at all! And if no film is any good without a proper conclusion, this is even truer of short films. Take \"fishy night\" for example: what a disappointing way to ruin such an interesting starting premise and gorgeous animation!In short, you can really tell they've invested quite a lot of money in the CGI. Hopefully, in the future they'll invest in the plots too.\n",
            "Same like all others here, after watching the first episode I coudn't stop until the end ! Finished it in the same day\n",
            "Tim Miller did a great job directing this and the CGI is simply mind-blowing\n",
            "This series impressed me so much that I felt the need to write a review, albeit short. The animation, the direction, the storylines in each is superb. I can't recommend this enough! Once you start watching, it's VERY hard to stop. Netflix nails this one out of the park!\n",
            "Every Episode is around 17 minutes long and every story is different with different genres. Most are good, some are bad while a few are excellent in stories but the art in the animation is stunning. Different 2D animations. Kudos to the animation artists, you have done some beautiful amalgamation of everything perfect in animation.\n",
            "Its pure art. You need a strong stomach but your eyes and soul will thank you.\n",
            "Create by Tim Miller and David Finch, a 18 episodes animation TV show. Each episode is around 10 mins, the shortest one only has 5 mins. All these episodes have different style, 2D, 3D or 2D rendering 3D, and all these episodes came from different studios all over the world.\n",
            "Although each episode is very short, the content in one episode is definitely not shallow. From the environment to politics, from gender equality to the biosphere rule. Almost every hot trending topic right now you can find it in the show as well. Meanwhile, various elements from famous IPs(intelligence properties), Ghost in the shell, Indiana Jones and many others could found in the show as well. I think the creators are trying to pay tribute to those marvellous works in this way.\n",
            "So far, it is a good show, but the reason why I give 8.5 not even higher is that some episodes are not finish their job as a story teller, leaving too much blank to audiences. I personally really hope that those studios could make a full length movie finish telling their story.\n",
            "Entertainment value: 7\n",
            "Visuals: 9\n",
            "Soundtrack: 8\n",
            "Plot: 6\n",
            "World building and depth: 8\n",
            "Characters and dialog: 5\n",
            "Total: 7\n",
            "In under 30 minutes, every episode of this Netflix' animated anthology is like a short trip to your wildest imagination and fantasy. Amazing episodes like \"Sonnie's Edge\" that delivers a future biopunked fusion between Pokemon and Avatar with a shocking graphic violence, \"Beyond the Aquila Rift\", an adult themed space exploration sci-fi horror, surely if Dead Space and Mass Effect have a baby with a spine-chilling twist plus animated hottie like Miranda Lawson, and \"Secret War\", an episode with Metro and Doom series vibe, all wrapped in an 18+ NSFW. Minus short duration, and not without the SJW propagandas, L,D+R is still frickin' awesome !\n",
            "EDIT (Season 3 - 5 stars):\n",
            "For me this is without question the weakest season of all three..The animation work continues to deserve high praise, not only that but I recently learned that different episodes are designed by different animation studios all over the world, which is amazing news!Regardless if I am into the animation or not (some is really bad in my opinion), it goes without saying that the work is incredible overall, I continue to be stunned by the ultra realistic ones!But the stories for this season are heavily focus on one genre mostly: horror. Of course personally that is not the most appealing one for me, so not to be unfair and rate it only due to the genre I feel that a ton of episodes display a lot of gore and violence and there's no much goal to it... I don't mind the violence but I don't like the cheap one either, there is no clear goal for the ridiculous gore and it just makes it uncomfortable and macabre.I am more of a fan when they mix the Sci-Fi with mystery and sure a pinch of horror but not as intense as they did on this one, I didn't enjoy it for the most part I merely appreciated the animation.Looking forward to see what they do next hope they shift their approach.-------------------------------------Season 1 and 2 (7.5 stars)I've seen both seasons at this point and one thing I can say for sure - this is the most amazing animated work in shows / movies I have ever seen.In some of the episodes the animation is so freakishly realistic that in some shots you have a hard time distinguishing if it's animated or actually real!So speaking in visual effects and animation for the most part it's easily a 10, the problem is the animation isn't enough...\n",
            "This is an anthology series so each episode has a different set and story completely unrelated with each other, the genre can vary a lot, it can be drama, comedy or horror and even though it's short stories some of them have thought provoking and shocking messages.Usually I love the realistic ones not only the animation but it's story, some I don't like the animation at all and others the story is just weak or vulgar and this is why is so difficult to rate the show.There are very few episodes that perfectly balance amazing animation and original story, there a lot that seem kind of random or exaggerated and not so good, so I guess my rating would be an average of all the episodes.\n",
            "Powerful. Meaningful. Great stories & so well animated! I loved it from start to finish. We need more like this A+++\n",
            "The same people who are mad about this series are the same ones who sent hate mail over Star Wars having a black stormtrooper. This series of NSFW cartoons is apparently threatening to the traditionally unwashed neckbeards and that in and of itself makes it a hit in my book. Give us more.\n",
            "Watching Love, Death & Robots was like watching an animated version of Black Mirror, only shorter, darker and with more adult theme. Every episodes are of beautiful animation and have excellent short story line. I only wish the episodes are much longer cause I can't stop watching them!\n",
            "Just watch it, and your will understand this is a true masterpiece.Finally a legendary show\n",
            "True, if a wonderful story is what you're looking for, then the show might disappoint you. But the scenes in every single episode are so impressive that it'll burnt into your mind, and you just keep laughing and being amazed.\n",
            "I liked the first season of Love Death + Robots, and the second season is just as interesting and enjoyable. The mix of animation styles is impressive, as are the plots of the various episodes. One thing that is obvious is that CGI is getting so good at photorealistic creations. It is getting more and more difficult to differentiate between CGI created human images and real people. Some people probably find that very unsettling, including a lot of actors who could eventually get less work. Technological advances are taking their toll on a lot of professions and jobs. I look forward to a third season of Love Death + Robots.\n",
            "Each story unique, each animation style different, and each plot line masterfully developed and every ending hitting you from the left side with no warning. You will enjoy some more than others, and you will rewatch your favorites with joy, looking for new details.Sonny's Edge, Shape-Shifters and Three Robots got my heart. I'm sure you're find the ones that will steal yours.\n",
            "I love the artwork in these short episodes! It's so beautifully done, a lush for the eye!!!\n",
            "Words can't really express how I enjoyed this show, it was just AMAZING. The animation was unique in each short, and even those who used similar animation such as Shapeshifters, Secret Wars and Beyond the Aquilla Belt, all had unique direction, plot and writting style that made it all stand out on it's own. Speaking of writting, every episode was fun beggining to end and some could even become series on their own. Hopefuly there will be a season 2 with more shorts and new directors and animators. Seeing shows like LDaR, Dragon Prince and the upcoming Klaus movie, seems like Netflix is giving modern animation the finger and investing on everything that have love and care every frame.\n",
            "I think im priviledged to say i have found this show early on. Its like a mix between the quality of blackmirror stories, where every episode is unique; but better. Im a HUGE fan of animation. This show takes animation to a whole new level. you have cartoon like episodes, relaity like episodes and all in between. The way in which it portrays adult themes sucha sex and gore is profoundly amazing. I cant recomend this show enough. The episode are those which one will continue to watch after they have binge watched the entire season. the timing of each unique episode is perfect and there is now need to make them longer. The only thing that would make this better would be more episodes.\n",
            "Netflix has truly outdone themselves with this show. Every episode offers captivating animations and great plot. You would think that an episode being 6 minuets would leave you wanting more but the few that are 6 minuets long are just as captivating as the rest. On top of that, the range of genres the show covers is impressive. You can watch a border-line horrifying episode and have the next be comedic. Even though every episode is great, some I highly recommend are, \"Sonnie's Edge, Three Robots, Beyond the Aquila Rift & Zima Blue\"\n",
            "From the first episode i can not stop watching. Its amazing in all levels! Animation stories... i just wish we have more work like this where each episode has different short story\n",
            "Gorgeous dark animation with a very well crafted short tale by Peter F. Hamilton.\n",
            "I almost thought it was the main antagonist was actually real and not animated.\n",
            "Like this series there are many such shorts on YouTube from various studios well worth the watch if you haven't already seen them.\n",
            "Amazing! I'm absolutely loving this and I want to see more. Plz let there be a series two :)\n",
            "One of the greatest visual events I have ever seen! Every episode is relatable to a game, film or era. Just wonderful. Thank you so much.\n",
            "I haven't finished all of the current episodes, I'm not too far into volume 2. I just finished Snow in the Desert and that was when I realized why this show is so breathtaking and unique. Most of the worlds where the show takes place are real, fleshed out and lived in. Every episode is a clean slate so the character that you fall in love with is never safe because they could die at any moment. Writers don't have to feel constrained about making a sequel or another episode so anything could happen at any moment. The episode Pop Squad was one of the best \"short stories\" I have ever seen. I see the show like a volume of short stories. It reminds me of The Twightzone because every episode is a self contained world. Sure, not all the worlds are equal and some might fall flat. I did not care for Ice. But the show can dust itself off and land a masterpiece in the next episode with Pop Squad. I think shows like this are important because it allows artists to take huge risks. Some of those risks have a huge pay off, some don't.\n",
            "I have never ever felt inclined to write a review for a movie or TV show in my life. I read reviews all the time\n",
            "But this show brought force to me to review it. Not because I love it so much and not because it's terrible. But because it's truly one of a kind and for that it deserves a 10/10. Every show on Netflix is competing. This show is trying to bring something new and something new it brought. I'll be honest before I say this next statement if this has been said prior to me sorry for a repetitive statement but I didn't read many reviews before watching this show and then feeling the compulsion to write a review. It reminds be a lot of the twightlight zone with a modern twist. Each episode is different and it's own plot. I'm only 4 episodes in but I get the idea. To keep this on the shorter side I will just get in to some pros and cons. The cons though are in no way to deter you from watching this show. Watch it!Pros:\n",
            "1. Animation like you have never seen before.2. Different stories each episode.3. Just out of this world stories. The scripts of nothing you have seen before and let's face it Netflix has the same script over and over.4. Bouncing of number 3 is the effort put into number 1. It's not like they relied on 1 to skate by. Number 1 was just part of it.5. This show is going to be something that others can use to build off of. It's amazing animation, story telling, and uniqueness will live on as a legacy. My hunch is this show is going to inspire many others to something similar but much better.Cons:\n",
            "1. Unfortunately, this series and innovative and original as it is far too short with every episode. I believe that's probably because it's expensive to make and they wanted to make as many stories as possible within the budget. I don't blame them but it is a setback on getting connected with a story and having it end in a few minutes.2. \"Season 1 was an absolutely masterpiece but wtf was season 2?! It felt like teasers with no plots but with a vine time limit of 7 seconds\" this was a quoteI saw on here and all I got to say 4 episodes in is this show has plot failures even in season 1 due to the short episodes. It's hard to play out a plot in 10 minutes.\n",
            "Netflix never fails to surprise you... Whenever i think what new could now be made.. Netflix is like boom.. This is my 60th netflix series and netflix has never failed to impress me seriously...\n",
            "I love this series. I really hope they make more seasons!!!\n",
            "99% of the people who love this are young males that are into video games. if that's you ... congratulations you will love this. if not you probably won't.the episodes are mostly extremely violent. the show should be called death, violence and violent robots. people who are into video games will love this. the rest of us will not.i did enjoy the animation ... perhaps next time netflix can create an animated anthology for adults that is centered around sex, love & robots ... with no violence.\n",
            "Amazing short animations, keep you interested for just the right amount of time. Still a better film than gravity.. You'll understand when you see it 😁\n",
            "I knew I loved it when I wanted to see a whole movie of every episode. I love every minute of every episode, great variety of concepts, different art styles and story telling. How can anyone hate this.\n",
            "Very high is quality!\n",
            "PS: with less violence it would be perfect\n",
            "Reminds us of Heavey Metal meets screen. Quick scifi hits that you won't stop thinking or talking about! Bloody awesome and I do mean bloody!\n",
            "Good show, some of the stories felt like a wild acid trip, over all fun and creative\n",
            "I have been reading science fiction short stories for decades and always thought a fair amount could be great on the screen.I recognize two or three each season. They should do better research because about half of each season's episodes are lame. The good news is the other half are really good.Animation is amazing for every story, though, so it makes it easier to suffer through a bad story.\n",
            "This is just fantastic and the quality of each story is just astounding.\n",
            "Series of short movies from different people and with unique stories. From pool machines, aliens, robots and more! Yes we have a Xbox 3000 (best version of Xbox).\n",
            "\"Love, Death & Robots\" is a masterclass in storytelling diversity and visual innovation. This anthology series delivers a captivating blend of science fiction, fantasy, and horror across its varied episodes. Each installment is a self-contained narrative, offering viewers a glimpse into a unique world crafted with meticulous attention to detail.One of the standout aspects of \"Love, Death & Robots\" is its stunning animation style, which ranges from hyper-realistic CGI to stylized hand-drawn artwork. This visual diversity enhances the storytelling experience, immersing audiences in worlds both familiar and fantastical.The series explores a wide range of themes, from the implications of advanced technology to the complexities of human nature. Despite the disparate settings and storylines, there's a cohesive thread running through each episode, connecting them thematically and emotionally.With its blend of thought-provoking narratives and jaw-dropping visuals, \"Love, Death & Robots\" is a must-watch for fans of science fiction and animation alike. It pushes the boundaries of storytelling in the digital age, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.\n",
            "I've been complaining about that why they don't use Pixar tech on movies beside animations for children. Finally they have done it. I congrats Netflix for this and Roma. They do really good and leading job.\n",
            "I loved this series from the first episode and looked through all episodes in one breath. I definitely recommend this as a great product.\n",
            "If you haven't watched it yet... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?! This series should be seen by the entire world. Something about it just makes me want WAYYYY more! I really hope netflix pumps out a 2nd season sometime soon. It is the funnest show ever. It will 100% keep you entertained. Anyone ages 18-40 will enjoy this.\n",
            "These shorts go from 3 to 10 but overall a pleasant ride. Some very cool ideas. Some HEAVY METAL vibes or GHOST IN THE MACHINE. Check this out!\n",
            "This might be the best anthology series on Netflix, which is saying a lot considering I'm a lifelong fan of American Horror Story. But every episode of this show is animated differently, and every episode feels different, and I love every single episode. You also have to respect the sheer creativity of the show. Every single episode is a different story and I cannot wait for volume two.\n",
            "A must watch series. The more you praise,the less it is.\n",
            "I cannot recall any viewing experience as consistently and as constantly as interestijng or exciting as this feast for the eyes. Each story is told in a unique style. Storylines vary widely. Presentations are perfect. I watched it all in one sitting. OMG! What a great visual trip!Please make more of these. Plesse!\n",
            "Episode after episode, scene after scene, this has to be one of the best experiences I've had with a series/movie.The animation, colors, art direction, writing (not all of them), plot twists (few episodes)..... everything was so creative and well done.The best part was how each episode was made with a different kind of art/animation like anime, CGI, live action etcA must watch for everyone who loves creativity and art.However some on the stories fall flat, ending abruptly, or has no real substance apart from visuals, so a true rating would be 8 or 9 but i give it a 10 because i want to see more stuff like LD&R.\n",
            "It is most likely the best Western animated series to come out in a long time. Most episodes will leave you begging for a full feature film. The variety of diverse stories, types of animations and the characters that this sci-fi series engulfs is actually mind-blowing! Not a single boring episode. I mean if you do get bored, you can always skip the episode because they are all standalone. Not that I ever skipped one.This is not to say that improvements can't be made... NEED MORE EPISODES!Western animations always lacked the experimental aspect of making an animated show. They just don't like taking risk anymore. Big studios always produced stuff that are sure to be a hit with the average Joe. Kudos to Netflix for getting this show up and running with all the blood and gore!\n",
            "Unique in its delivery, Love, Death + Robots is enjoyably inconsistent across episodes. All loosely sticking to the titular theme, brilliant instances of action, horror, romance and comedy are shown in alternate episodes, largely to a high quality. Not all are as good as others, but they are all so bitesize, usually lasting between 10-15 minutes, that catching an episode is refreshing no matter the genre.Graphic and certainly for an adult audience, the animators do not shy away from anything on screen. Plus, as the story changes each time, so too does the animation, ranging from the life-like (or using live action) to video game graphics, cartoons and animé, every one is unique.Each installment is unlike the last, and the series is unlike anything else too.\n",
            "This show is amazing! Very good short stories, graphics are flawless, distorted graphics and voices are on point, and I enjoy how dark some of the episodes are. Extremely creative. Season 1 was the best in my opinion because this series was so random and watching all 18 episodes I just couldn't wait for the next one.Season 2 was honestly kind of trash. I'm not gonna lie. There were at least 2 decent episodes but the rest of it I was just extremely confused and disappointed because I knew they could've a lot better.Season 3 was a lot better. I just think that they could have added more episodes and made the good ones alittle longer also. The suspense was most definitely on point. Overall though I hope to see more seasons in the future.\n",
            "First season 18 episodes, all interesting good strories mainly sci-fi with some horror and or humor. One of the best season of the year.Second season 8 episodes, mainly horror, without humor. First two episode was great, but the rest wasnt interesting at all. Big mistace.\n",
            "I freaking love this. Every episode is unique in its own way. I have to admit that i did not like every episode, but overall it was an amazing experience. Noticed alot of hate comments... Saying about the nudity and the violence, thats a form of art aswell we live in the 21st century there is nothing wrong with those kind of things. There was alot of creativity and plot twists, cant wait for another season. 9/10\n",
            "Each and everyone has the uniqueness. Different genres that make it clear awesomeness. The last one is huge and heavy. Must watch animation shorts. Personally I prefer The Witness, The secret war..\n",
            "This collection of animated short stories is definitely some of the best that Netflix has produced. There wasn't one that I disliked, though I liked one less than the others and a couple didn't seem to fit, but it's a good anthology series altogether. Comprised of short stories, original ideas, and individual animation styles, \"Love, Death & Robots\" delivers something for everyone and a lot for anyone who loves sci-fi.\n",
            "I have never in my life been so emotionally shocked, straight up punched square my very high expectations for moving arts.\n",
            "Each one of the episodes is truly magnificent and I would do a disservice to my fellow fans if I didn't try this hard to manifest what I experienced.\n",
            "I really hope they continue the series,\n",
            "I would love that\n",
            "I am an anime watcher. Sure I watch American animated shows and movies, sometimes European too. But for me anime as a form of animation and to an extend a storytelling is superior to something like Final Space or even Rick and Morty. That is why even though I watch Western cartoons the number of them are much lower then the Japanese.\n",
            "Here comes Love, Death and Robots that changes my perspective on animation. True CGI anime always has been poor and only currently it got better, but here in this show CGI animation is on the Everest of quality and Japanese still at the bottom.\n",
            "I question myself and anyone else, with a top level like this, why bother hire live actors, some of the episodes look as real as live action movies.\n",
            "Thematically each episode is as different as the animation each one has. I would say this is the rare case where animation is more important then a plot, moreover it conveys more meaning then the story or dialogues. Episode 3 has almost no lines but it is so impactful. Indeed it is far from best episode in the season, but the point is , the image, the animation has ability to tell a story as much as a script.\n",
            "Something like episode 6 or 17 are the weakest both in animation and in the story, but they are still enjoyable.\n",
            "I am looking forward to season 2. It is like Black Mirror being animated or even better.\n",
            "So this theme is exactly what I like to see more, every episode following a particular storyline in short times just like books.And because of that maybe it's better to rate each chapter on the specific episode section on IMDb and rate the whole series based on the overall conclusion, isn't it?This type of thing will never get boring for long and endless series.\n",
            "Season one was amazing, season 2 was OK but not really worth a re-watch. Excited to hear of season 3 so will be picking that up on day 1.So I need to increase to 150 characters, and that's what this sentence is for.\n",
            "There are no words for this entire series, every single episode is just a masterpiece.\n",
            "Especially Volume 3, episode \"Three Robots: Exit Strategies\"\n",
            "You cant hit the Human Nail in the head better than this. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.The whole series is great watching, and I love it, some shows not for all, but that is for you to judge.GREAT SERIES, WATCH IT!\n",
            "Love, Death a Robots is a true piece of art that belongs to the streaming service - Netflix. The first and most remarkable feature of all is the animation. It is definitely the key in the success of the show. The idea of the series is rather simple: you get a bunch of short movies that are not related to one another and that focus on different themes and genres, (A bit like \"Black Mirror\"). The difference between this show and \"Black Mirror\" is that \"Black Mirror\" does have a motive and meaning in all of it's different episode.Love, Death a Robots is more complicated, at one point you did wish there would be some sort of narrative or idea that connects between all the different stories and episodes. Overall I believe the fact that this series is so wide with stories, characters and different genres is what makes the series so special. I could have noticed that most of the episodes focused on technology, science fiction and supernatural. With every short story having a slight of humor. Every episode has a deep meaning such as \"Zima Blue\" and \"Fish Night\". Some episodes are mind blowing and have a major twist in the plot like \"Beyond the Aquila Rift\" and \"The Witness\". Some episodes are mainly for action and humor likewise \"Suits\", \"Sonnie's Edge\", \"The Secret War\", \"Blind spot\", \"When the Yogurt Took Over\" and \"Alternate Histories\".My favorite episode was \"Three Robots\", not only the minor references that were made but also the whole vibe of the episode was really uplifting. I also would have wished the episodes were a bit longer and would have give more intel over the characters, there were moments where I wanted to explore the story even better and find out what happened to each character in each short movie.Season two was slightly disappointing, maybe not as much as fans would assume, I believe it had a lot of potential but due to the short amount of episodes it couldn't be compared to season 1. If it had the same amount of episodes such as in season 1 (18), I believe there would have been much to talk about. I am highly anticipating for the third season (coming 2022) and can't wait to explore new stories and worlds in this masterpiece series.\n",
            "Such amazing storytelling in such diverse and varied media. A joy from start to finish.\n",
            "Few shows tap into the animation of people as much as this show,is every episode great?no I'd say ,but ever single episode is unique it's in own right and Is a fresh new idea .this show takes a cliché Idea or premise and changes it in. Big way too make its own original story,for example sonnies edge cyberpunk fighting matches aren't particularly unique,megalobox did that before this but this show episode is so special simply because of the variations of the people and objects in it, for instance the monsters they they fight with, both monsters have their own specialties and areas of expertise , that element of the monsters makes them infinitely more interesting than just a vessel for main character, and the over arcing plot in this episode is extremely fascinating and is in and of itself is very intriguing story, throw monsters beating each other to death, and it is just amazing,every episode is like that,something cliché done in the least cliché way possible, in other words it has its own spin on the formula,and this show has some of most breathtaking animation and animation styles in animation,The realism in Shapeshifter's is nothing short of breath, and the animation style in sims blue is perfection, this show takes a very different approach to very cliché ideas and inserts its own concepts with him, I strongly recommend this show.\n",
            "Overall amazing Animation (almost looks real) and other cartoonish animation are also awesome and very new, like never seen before.And about the story : Some was good and some was ok ok type... Some stories make you stick to the screen, and some was just weirdo...\n",
            "Each and every episode brings something different to the series. It's captivating, entertaining, haunting... I feel like the first and third seasons are better, they both have something extra to them. Second season got a little \"over worked\", If that makes sense..\n",
            "I LOVE THIS show!!\n",
            "When I watched the first season my mind was blown, and then I got on with my life, then new notification in NETFLIX! S02 is coming! I was so excited, and after I watched it in one session I can truly say, OH MY GOD! Not gonna spoil but wow wow wow!!!!!! I wish Netflix would make a lot more contact like this\n",
            "The last episode was crazy sad. This series is a true wonder! Go and watch it now.\n",
            "This series, like all the past ones were pure ecstasy and a wonder. The imagination of the human mind at its best. These are the Mona Lisa's of the future. They can be the backbone worlds of the metaverse...I need to watch these on a mind opening drug to unveil the subtle hidden messages behind each of these episodes. Jibaro was the dance between Mother Nature and humans. She came offering all her wealth and life and was met by greed and violence. Mother natures blood can heal just as it's pain can destroy. In the final days of human carnage and destruction when she can take it no more, she will erupt in a violent dance and raise all of natures forces with a roaring scream to claim back itself from the infection and then be reborn into a new world free from human infestation. Absolute poetry in these works of art. Kudos to the entire teams that worked on this project! We bow to you!\n",
            "Truely masterpieces of short stories inclusive next gen cinemati art.\n",
            "For those of us who grew up reading \"Heavy Metal\" magazine and may have seen the movie, this series definitely scratches that itch. This is more than Twilight Zone Sci-Fi. It's a guilt pleasure to take the ride. I hope more episodes are produced. I also hope that the younger generation can tap into what might be called \"source material\" because this show is everything \"Heavy Metal\" was. I'm wondering if or how much the creators may have been inspired by the art and stories of that bold publication. Kudos for being different, for being edgy, for the unbounded use of imagination. I'm stopping this review now as I have a few episodes remaining. Check out Sammy Hagar's signature tune on the \"Heavy Metal\" soundtrack!\n",
            "I don't think I've been this hyped about a tv show in a long time.Since I'm not a fan of episodic shows, I didn't expect much from this one. But all the different animations and drawing styles enchanted me. I kept waiting to see what the next episode would bring.Love, death and robots has given us a wait to watch full movies in 15 minutes. Every chapter develops new and complex stories without getting too overwhealming. It deals with subjects that, were they made into a movie, would probably be too cliché. But by only showing the climax of the stories, the show keeps you at the end of your seat constantly.Filled with amazing and complex characters and a great number of plot twists that will blow your mind.And it's gory. So very, beautifuly gory. The level of violence is off the charts and I'll simply love it. The explicity and rawness of the show it's what makes it unique.I'm only taken a point away because there were 3 chapters (when the yogurt took over, alternative stories and zima blue) that I particulary did not like.Still, the test of the 15 chapter were either good, great of fantastic.My favourite ones would be:\n",
            "1- Beyond the aquila rift\n",
            "2- Sonnie's edge\n",
            "3-Shape-shifters\n",
            "4-Helping hand\n",
            "5-The secret war\n",
            "Really OUTSTANDING animation and creativity, the only thing i would change is the lenght of each chapter cause they are something really worth watching. Amazing\n",
            "I think it's going to be a turning point for the anime movies production!The stories were unexpected, shocking sometimes and emotionally\n",
            "interactive despite how short they were! some of the story building were not that good but overall it was brilliant.The art direction and production are a masterpiece.Overall it's a worth watching show I totally recommend it.\n",
            "The volume 3 will entertain you just like the volume 2. Can't say it got better but still some unique stories with great animation makes it a worth watch.\n",
            "This short format allows a lot of great ideas to see the screen, that would otherwise never be made into a whole film ot TV show. There is more great writing, great visuals and engaging surprises here than a barrel full of 'normal' film fare. Very very recommended entertainment, and a sincere hope this is the start of more to come, please producers...\n",
            "I have enjoyed every episode in this anthology series. Some more than others. Some made me laugh. Some made me squirm. If you are a fan of adult Sci-Fi (and in some cases I mean ADULT) then definitely give it a shot. The average episode is no longer than 15 minutes, so it won't take up too much of your time.\n",
            "As an professional animator and artist, I can say that I really appreciated the various styles of animation in the series - varying from cutting edge to some pretty limited/stylized animation. A special shout out to Digic for their episode - some of the most impressive shading and simulation I've seen - just jaw-dropping stuff.The stories are varied, but mostly predictable, and pretty much all center around violence of some kind. If you remember Heavy Metal magazine, well, you'll have a good feel for most of the stories. My biggest gripe with the series was the out of place and in-your-face gratuitous nudity, profanity, and gore. It made the series feel like a political/cultural (SJW) statement more than a series of *stories*. Yes, those elements have a specific place in specific stories - but most of these episodes felt like they started with an agenda and tried to wrap a story around it - even if it kept jarring the viewer out of their sense immersion.I despise this kind of film-making - it's political, simplistic, shallow, and amateur - everything that will give this a very short shelf-life. What a waste of talent. C'mon guys - you're better than this!8 stars for the technical aspects. -7 Stars for the stories and adolescent use of excessive SJW dog whistles and nudity/profanity. Given Netflix's pushing of all things culturally degrading, I'm not surprised - and you shouldn't be either.What a waste of great potential.\n",
            "Madcap, reinventive, super beautiful and ever changing view into a small story that feels like it belongs to a huge universe. More please.\n",
            "Definitely one of the best shows on Netflix i've watched in a long time.Theres comedy, theres action, great story telling.Just wish the episodes were longer, but still, 100 percent worth giving a watch.\n",
            "Reminds me of the Animatrix but on an whole other level. Some of the best animation and storytelling I've seen in a long time. The depth and emotion that is achieved in such a short time is incredible. A Masterpiece. Keep it coming Netflix we need more.\n",
            "Ever walk away from an episode or a movie changed? Where you think back frequently and day dream about the what if? Even if not, I swear you will find out with this show. I BEG you to give it a chance. I stumbled on this series at my friends house imploring me to continue and now I would rank it one of my favorite series of all time. Please give it a chance!\n",
            "Vividly intense, but if you like sci-fi, this is a good watch. Intense, but good.\n",
            "The animation is stunning, the stories are great and many of the episodes could easily adapt into full TV shows. Maybe not the episode with the intelligent yoghurt, that was pretty out there, but again, I'd be curious enough to see where it goes. Very very recommendable!\n",
            "I've reviewed it more on tumblr on my blog@smoochesbyjannae. You can go and check which episodes stood out more to me. Also Sonnies Edge was one of the BEST episodes.\n",
            "Loved it! All i can see, it made me feel like how i do with Black Mirror episodes! I wish they were slightly longer, and more of them! Loved the different styles of animation and story lines! watched all of these in one go! Can't wait for the next season!\n",
            "The only downfall to season 2 is the fact that it ended. We were blessed with 8 episodes instead of the 18 from season 1. Every minute of it was truly amazing! Please, don't EVER cancel this series.\n",
            "I am impressed how they can make these short episodes feel so much longer. There is so much depth to each one.\n",
            "Reminds me of Neil Blomkamp's Oats Studios, check that out (on YouTube) if you liked LDR for sure. Very gory, very sci-fi, even has a \"God\" mini-verse thing.\n",
            "Anyways, the animation/CGI in LDR is top notch, felt like I was tripping at times. I feel like they went a bit overboard on the violence but maybe I'm getting more sensitive to all that. Still it takes animal cruelty videos or snuff clips to make most sick, and I felt sick a few times watching some scenes.\n",
            "That being said not all episodes are violent, goes at a great pace if you decide to watch it all at once.\n",
            "The best for me were \"Lucky 13\", \"Good Hunting\", \"Sucker of Souls\", \"Secret War\", and \"Ice Age\", but honestly they're all great. 10/10 keep 'em comin'\n",
            "Each episode is better than the last. I love that they are short, and using state-of-the-art animation.\n",
            "You have no excuse for not watching it. You want to see how a movie (short film) ca be a form of art? Watch this. It will leave you wanting for more.\n",
            "For so much more...\n",
            "This is incredibly good, but the \"love\" thing did not really happen, there was a little sex here and there, but in my Opinion not enough. That's why i'm only giving 9/10. The Rest is perfect, i love gore etc.\n",
            "I don't even know what to say about it. Just watch. You won't be sorry.\n",
            "I've just binged watched this entire series. FANTASTIC!\n",
            "NETFLIX have done something truly great here.\n",
            "This collection of short works is a fresh dose of awesome. Unique and different styles of animation and storytelling. Watched 7 episodes and just had to jump on here to write what is in fact my first ever review on imdb after nearly a decade of being a member.Just like how book anthologies can give us a great reading experience Love, Death and Robots allows us to enjoy the creative works of different people.This has endless potential as each season is not bound by a singular cast and plot. Its just a bunch of great short films.Hope to see season 2 soon.\n",
            "9/10\n",
            "This somewhat reminds me of the Animatrix, though none of the stories are interconnected. If you are a Sci-Fi fan, then you will easily binge-watch this season (hopefully more are to come). My favorite is three robots, because my wife brought two cats into our marriage and she bought me the game \"exploding kittens\". You will have to watch the episode to fully understand, but it is very funny.\n",
            "There really are some people just not smart enough to get this kind of stuff. There you have the hateful reviewers.That said, this is one of the best things I've ever watched. Not every idea is \"original\". Some of it is homage, some of it just similar in plot or theme to other things that have come before. Here's what's IMPORTANT to know: the great majority of these shorts are AS GOOD or BETTER than anything and everything that came before. Lucky 13, Aquila Rift, Sonnie's Edge, it goes on. All have a scifi or fantasy bent and all are animated beautifully. There is one that's mostly live action, but it's cool, too.CHECK IT OUT!\n",
            "I've a confused review... whoever has made it .. the creativity is awesome ... animation is out of the world ... the best I have seen .. I just wished the story live was better n there was continuity to each episode .. some stories don't make any sense at all .. must watch but nothing great when it comes to the story ... hope next season would have a better story line .. cheers\n",
            "Thank you netflix!!! Thank you very much! i enjoyed every second of this masterpiece!! Every episode was incredible, congrats to the whole team, one of the best shows i have ever seen\n",
            "Loved every single episode, The CGI is better than everything I saw so far.\n",
            "Each episode has its own style, and its own theme.I hope with LOVE DEATH + ROBOTS more adult series will be produced in the future.-Waiting for a second season is the only bad thing about the show. :D\n",
            "I gave this a watch after reading an article on it. I have never been into cartoon/anime or manga which this feels like in some episodes so a bit of a gamble from what I would normally watch and wow has that gamble paid off.Extraordinary throughout with each episode giving you something to think about afterwards.My favorite was ep 3 the witness which is provoking and unique and left me thinking about it for at least one hour after.The yoghurt takes over in a world where trump is president seems oddly achievable.I would recommend this to anyone and would advise to go in without looking into and without any prejudements and enjoy it for what it is. A well thought out and beautifully produced extraordinary piece of cinema, that you will likely watch over and over again. The imdb rating is highly justified and this is something completely different to anything I have seen in the past.\n",
            "This is my first IMDB review, but for this I had to do it. This is one of the best series I've seen in a very long time. Unexpected, strange twist, love the various looks. Story lines are great, funny, weird everything. Only thing is I wish there were more episodes.\n",
            "This must be the most gorgeous animation series I have ever witnessed, just wow.. Smart and thourough plots as well! Enjoyed every second of every season, i'm actually amazed.\n",
            "As soon as i saw the trailer headline on Netflix I knew i was absolutely going to love this work of art and boy let me tell you I could not stop watching. Every single episode was stunning with characters and scenery that you'd go to sleep dreaming about. It's incredible how they were able to create these worlds and stories within a small amount of time. Netflix has a team of wizards when it comes to their unique and creative ideas. Crazy excited about season 2.\n",
            "Binged it all now I need more. Epic and so unique. Three robots is absolutely jokes\n",
            "Mature, humorous, dark, gritty, fun, weird.\n",
            "Something for everyone.\n",
            "Top-notch storytelling and animations.\n",
            "A. MUST. WATCH.\n",
            "Normally, with an anthology, you get one or two really good episodes, a mediocre bunch and then one or two that stink, but I was pleasantly surprised by Love, Death & Robots. Out of all the episodes, there were only two that I thought to be mediocre and the rest were outstanding. I ended up binging the whole thing in one night and was wanting more.\n",
            "The show is great not gonna lie, Every episode has me thinking about whether to trust what I see or not, they change the story every time I mean if you start binging the show you cant predict whats gonna happen next it just happens and you like it too and it's well made that it can be watched from any episode its all anthology episodes and it's just too good of a show I'm just happy I got to see this show after a long wait... watch it, its a must watch and not even gonna take time its just small episodes... basically Smaller and animated black mirror episodes, watch it!!!\n",
            "This show tells the stories of both today and tomorrow in the form of amazingly crafted animated shorts. All 18 episodes have a unique and refreshing animation style, which makes it sorta abstract. Delving into issues from how we'll go extinct due to global warming to the war in Afghanistan. While simultaneously exploring the world of fantasy and awe. I'd definitely want to see some of the episodes made into a series of their own.\n",
            "This show is on one hand, extremely freaking weird. But on the other hand it shows great animation and interesting stories. The show is very watchable. But sometimes there are way to much stuff going on to where it is weird or just makes no sense. But overall it is a fun show, and if you like shows like Twilight Zone and Black Mirror then you will love this.\n",
            "Something which is beyond our imaginations. Just beautiful\n",
            "Love it. Science fiction short stories rendered with cutting edge or experimental digital animation methods. Don't let the hyper-violence of the first episode put you off. This alone was worth my months subscription to Netflix.\n",
            "I absolutely loved this anthology! I don't usually watch animation series but decided to give this a shot because the trailer was interesting. I did not regret it at all and binged this series in one go! I love how every episode is different, in the animation style and the plot!\n",
            "This series is definitely worth it watching! 10/10\n",
            "You've done it! I would love to see more of everything! Of course, some clips were more interesting than others but hey! 10 outta 10!\n",
            "Here is where Sci fi changes for good. Each story is its own universe.Heavy metal passes the baton.Please don't rate or watch if you aren't a sci fi fan. It's just not for you. For the rest of us, simply sublime!\n",
            "I've been using IMDB for about 10 years. First time I created an account, just to say how amazing this is.Truly a work of art.\n",
            "I didn't even know i needed this in my life but thank god it has come and this is the greatest thing Netflix has ever given me, my only negavtive is that the episodes should be longer! i need more and more and asap\n",
            "Note : genius\n",
            "scale :Beauty\n",
            "never saw something like it\n",
            "just incredible\n",
            "Overally all of the episodes were good but some of them was a masterpiece.\n",
            "Beautiful, unique, and exceptional series! I wish the second season had more episodes.\n",
            "This series is exactly what you expect from a series titled 'Love, Death & Robots' made by Netflix.Stories are variable in quality, but hey...I enjoyed them all.As for the 'critics' comment asbout sexualising women etc....show me any game and Marvel film that doesn't....even Black Panther does a good job of this (that critics have picked for an Oscar...hmm).Anyway, on to the series....\n",
            "The animation is EXCELLENT. Variable and fantastic. When each episode starts, i think 'oh i'm not sure about this animation style'...within 30secs, I'm thinking 'I cant see any other animation style working for this episode'.Every other aspect is good...better than most films released currently, comparatively.\n",
            "Every episode so far is visually and story wise breathtaking!\n",
            "What a fantastic combination of a diverse series of animation styles and story lines, all of which were you unique in their own way, yet each one engaging and full of excitement. Really hoping for a continuation!\n",
            "After having delayed watching this for quite some time, I just didn't think it would be my cup of tea, I finally decided to give it a shot one evening. And I'm really glad I did, because the overall experience is amazing and I definitely recommend it.Now notice I said overall experience. That's because, as I mentioned in the title, this is a series of many different flavors. And not all of them are good. Goes without saying this is subjective, but the quality really, really varies between each short story. Some are straight up 9/10, while others go as low as 5/10. My personal favorites are \"Sonnie's Edge\", \"Three Robots\" and \"Good Hunting\". After you watch it you might agree or disagree, that's just the nature of the show.I have to mention the A-list voice acting, though. There are some serious names in the credits and it was a lot of fun to try and recognize each voice and where I might have heard them before.Love, Death + Robots is definitely a breath of fresh air and I hope we see another season at some point in the future.\n",
            "This anthology is so unique and an animation masterpiece!! I can't say enough about how great this. You need to experience it yourself.\n",
            "Very entertaining series, surprised me, makes up for every minute, very well produced and with very amazing animation effects. The only observation is regarding the \"age\" allowed, +18.\n",
            "I'm giving this 9/10 out of 10 stars, because the viewing experience is really up there (I don't think there wasn't a moment where I didn't feel something per film), and it's beautifully crafted. I'd say it lost a star simply because some of the shorts weren't long enough.This anthology seems to pay homage to the whimsy and fascination of old sci-fi films and animation, with a breathtaking new aesthetic from the possibilities of today's technology. It offers multiple perspectives of the state of the world today, and what could be, and even defines experiences with a lot more depth than previously imagined.The series offers a wide array of touching stories, each complimenting each other with the emotions it evokes. From tragedy, to romance, comedy, satire, anger, hopelessness, and a deep sense of warmth.The aesthetics are absolutely beautiful, and the exploration of stories through a sci-fi lens is refreshing. It feels new, fresh, and looks into the 'what-if' of life. This has left me with a feeling of whimsy and fascination, something I haven't felt from watching something in a long time.I've been a fan of Tim Miller since his GWTDT sequence, and I'm so glad he's been given another moment to shine, alongside with the animators who also deserve this moment. I sincerely look forward to seeing more from him.I'm so pleased Netflix gives artists a platform to showcase their work. You can see the passion, the exploration, and the creative expression in this anthology series.If you are looking to be intrigued, are a fan of sci-fi themes, and want to explore the possibilities of what animation can do, or simply seeking mental enrichment, this show is for you.\n",
            "Every episode reminded me of exactly what it is I love about animated shorts and movies. The writing was excellent. The humor spot on and the action sequences absolute nail biters all. I would have gladly paid theater admission to see that on the big screen. And each and every episode was pure art. I can't say enough about this series. Dear Lord come out please let them make a season 2!\n",
            "Honestly, who even animates this thing, because damn! It is so visually appealing and accurate that it's a wonder to watch for the way it's been drawn alone, not to mention the great storylines and the way they manage to capture so much in so little screen time. Most of the times, the story is deeper than one would expect and the characters are very well thought out.\n",
            "This is definitely not everyone's cup of tea: Love, Death + Robots could as well been named Sex, Violence + SciFi! As a fan of the 80's and 90's Heavy Metal (as in the graphic magazine with sci-fi & fantasy themes) I totally loved LDR.The visuals are stunning and different in every episode. The styles varies from hyper realistic CGI à Call of Duty type video games to anime style to hyper realistic cartoon styles animation, and no matter in what style the episode is made in, it never feel \"out of touch\" or misplaced.Like in the mentioned HM magazines, the stories are short (around 15 minutes per ep.) which is a good thing: The storytelling is tight, you never get bored with unnecessary subplots (which doesn't mean I have a short attention span, but I feel many weak subplots are forced into many movies or shows today to make them \"deeper\" and to extend a TV episode length story into a movie length story).\n",
            "The episodes are a good mix of different genres (though with one foot of curse heavily cemented in SciFi&Fantasy department): There's action (ep. 1) followed by humor (ep. 2) and then mystery (ep. 3), horror, satire, drama and so on, which means for you as viewer don't know what to expect.Some reviewers have issues with the character developments which in 15 minutes episodes are undeniable very two-dimensional. I personally don't miss deeper character developments in these kind of stories: You as a viewer are thrown in midway in some unknown character's life and try to puzzle together what's happening, and then waiting to see what the plot twist will be (there's almost alway's some kind of a plot twist in the end in these kind of Twilight Zone/Black Mirror stories, and often also quite predictive, especially if you have watched or read these kind of stories before).It feels like Netflix really have given the creators freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. The show doesn't hold anything back (meaning many episodes are very NSFW, with gratuitous sex and violence, and even some erected male genitals which usually is a MAJOR no-no) and is a wonderful wacky mixture of graphic styles and stories (action, horror, humor, drama and even philosophical themes). Just sit back in you chair and enjoy the ride!\n",
            "It's weird, It's different, It's unique which makes it enjoyable.\n",
            "Love it, very reminiscent of the Animatrix where you don't have to like all of them but a majority of it is damn good.\n",
            "I haven't seen an animated anthology this pristine and rich since The Animatrix. If you're a lover of animated adult science fiction then you'll love this grimy, mature take on the genre. The 18 stories featured in this series were breathtaking, hilarious, moving, and unbelievably unique. If you're 18 or older and looking for something new and fresh to watch... Love, Death & Robots should be moved to the top of your watchlist.\n",
            "Honestly. What can I say that has not been said here already? I have never been so thoroughly amazed.. enthralled... just... the animation was so beautifully done! just wow. My mouth fell open so many times! I have re-watched quite a few of the episodes. Absolute shear magnificence! Please please PLEASE keep this series going!\n",
            "Within 17 minutes this episode fit so much into it. With so many twists and turns. It really seemed like as each minute passed the show only got better. The ending was full of surprise. This one episode could be the base of an entire series. Just wow.\n",
            "Behind this series there are very well written short stories that catalyze the beauty of every different animation style.\n",
            "As it is an anthology, each episode is independent. Therefore some episodes are really good, very interesting (like the second one, the yogurt one, the good hunt, Zima Blue), some are ok, and others are awfull.\n",
            "Well, the Idea behind this is great! I enjoyed the show a lot and i can recommend it to anyone.\n",
            "Good quality of animation. Style, design with a tech/magic ambientation. Exquisite.\n",
            "Sonnie's Edge - Decent fights, \"edgy\"Three Robots - Humorous mankind observationsThe Witness - Nifty despite pubesSuits - Probably best charactersSucker of Souls - Nosferatu gone wildWhen the Yoghurt Took Over - Delightfully weird humorBeyond the Aquila Rift - Makes ya thinkGood Hunting - WTF (Why the fursh*t?)The Dump - Nasty yet wholesomeShape-Shifters - Some gruesome battlesHelping Hand - Better than BullockFish Night - Beautiful yet nightmarishLucky 13 - Barely remember itZima Blue - ACTUALLY AMAZING, WOW!Blindspot - I had funIce Age - The funniest oneAlternate Histories - Yeah, I giggledSecret War - Would play gameSeriously, though, this is one of the most varied (in terms of content and genre, just as well as quality) and unpredictable shows on the planet, let alone Netflix. Definitely watch it.\n",
            "Each episode is a short, mostly animated, film. Each one is masterfully crafted, true eye candy & art. A real treat to watch, but may take a bit of stamina to sit through the whole series if you are faint-hearted: The series carries a lot of R-Rated imagery - the most prominent being violence which includes gore as well as & sometimes including female nudity with lovemaking. The purpose for the film's though, while visually sensational, are not fully void of intelligence, wit or thought: they each carry quality story-telling that carries significant messages for consideration.I know I'll find myself rewatching every episode & though I'll have my favourites, I can't say there was a single one that wasn't exceptional in exocution & well, ... damn cool.My only criticism is that the title is so cute, which suggested for me, & set up an expectation for, more variety in subject matter: the majority of stories are quite violent as opposed to cute, & I felt that overall they each carried very masculine qualities. I wonder at the percentage of womem involved in the writing & exocution of each episode. Since there are so many episodes, more variety of content containing more exploration of how Love, Death & Robots could be combined would be appreciated.Please make more !!!\n",
            "Short beautiful episodes. There are no unnecessary talk, moody scenes, family trees. This show is completely opposite of traditional soap operas. Title, bang-bang, credits! The only wishes are less blood and more alive actors. I was very happy to see ones in the Ice Age episode\n",
            "One bye one cyberpunk masterpieces! Looking forward to season 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
            "Season 2: blahhhh\n",
            "Season 3: very good, just wish the stories would keep going.I hope they make shows off of some of the ideas they had. Way too good of material for these short segments, and extremely high quality CGI. Sometimes I think it's real actors in the beginning. Then I'm like dammm, that's a cartoon person.\n",
            "I tried going through season one. There are some cool ideas, such as the civilization in the freezer, and the three robots, but generally the rest was a little too extreme in some way for my personal taste.The animation is quite spectacular though. I can certainly give it that.\n",
            "All parts are good, except for one - the 17th. My own rating of the 17th series is minus 10!\n",
            "Love, Death and Robots is an anthology series made by producers such as Tim Miller (Deadpool) and David Fincher (House of cards & Fight Club). Each episode has a distinct style and tone due to outsourcing the work to many animation studios around the world. The episodes are short, averaging about 15 minutes each, but they each tell a story owning a different style and charm.Love, Death and Robots does exactly what the title states, it explores themes of love and death while mixing robots in to suggest the overall genre will be sci-fi. The series is science-fiction in it's best form, exploring cyberpunk, to steampunk, to modern realism and even with fantasy mixed in as well. Most of the episodes are adaptations of famous science-fiction authors such as John Scalzi, Peter F Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds and more. Hence, you know the story is rooted in capable hands. I thoroughly enjoyed Love, Death and Robots. It's fun, weird and capable of subverting expectations. Its beautiful animation can easily make up the series because it is both alluring and vivid. The mature style also stands out as animation rarely deviates from it's more child-friendly ratings, only these days we are getting more adult animation, as we have seen they can be an effective medium.Not every episode maintains the previous episode's mood or tone, hence it's best to watch each episode as a digestible bite. Some of the episodes have a different quality, but others might pique your captivation. Hence, it's hard to objectively rate each episode as it boils down to personal preference and existing expectations. However, the overall experience of the series has been unique in exploring the boundaries of the medium and bolstering brilliant narratives. This is an exceptional series, made up largely by the sum of its parts. Do check it out.\n",
            "Three things make this series a completely amazing series.Story: Very good story story telling. We get a glimpse on the life of various characters. Most of them being inspired by sci-fi writers. They have done a great job adapting the medium of storytelling to one that fitted the story best.Animation: This medium has allowed the liberties needed to bring some projects to life. The insane realism of some of the stores made difficult to even imagine how some of the shots where made.No PG constraints: It feels that the current trend of catering to most of the population outright kills most of the projects that want to explore that side of story-telling. It didn't feel in your face about it at all. The reality is that blood, nudity and sex are very natural things and trying to completely eradicate them from TV is very sad.\n",
            "This show honestly very much impressed me and Netflix really outdid themselves. Every episode is so different and incredible within themselves. I feel like I could've watched some of these episodes as full length movies. Some of the most realistic cgi I've ever seen when applicable but the art styles in other episodes is enough to fall in love with every time. Nearly every idea in every episode is so unique and most so interesting that it's easy to enjoy no matter what genre you prefer. It's extremely original. Overall this is absolutely worth the watch. I really don't have much to complain about but I can't give it a 10/10 because as good and amazing as it is, it's impossible to say it's perfect. The one thing I would complain about is that they're a bit overzealous at times with the nsfw content, some of the jokes in many episodes fall a bit flat, and I feel they try to make you feel too attached at times with the limited screen time each story has. However this show more than makes up for what it lacks and I will recommend it 100% of the time.\n",
            "This is magnum opus for anthology artists. Can not stop think about this series, perfect.\n",
            "Just another proof human fantasy has no limits. Wow! Mind-blowing and yet so phylosophical, deep and intriguing. I wish to erase my memory and watch it again!!!\n",
            "This is why I pay for Netflix! Sci-fi at its best.Vignettes of wonderful, but short stories (most are animated). Each one short enough to satisfy, but leaving us hungry for more.NSFW, and definitely should not be watched with the little ones. But perfect for binging.\n",
            "Every story is best of the best. Well selected, with depth, with focus and with efforts made. I repeatedly watch them according to my mood.Truly hope Season 3 is on the way!!!!!\n",
            "A trend you'll notice with the first volume is people only give high marks to the \"serious\" episodes. Volume 2 is every bit as perfect as the first. I can't wait to rewatch it as much as I did before.\n",
            "Ate it all raw. Best animated series on Netflix or anywhere EVER!\n",
            "A short story / film anthology with some of the best technical standards & artistic variety of story telling and animation I've ever seen.Great from start to finish, each episode with a twist / ending worth waiting for. Only warning is that it's for ADULTS ONLY with very strong language, explicit sexual imagery / themes and bloody violence throughout. But the swearing/nudity/gore tends to add authenticity, and a sense of genuine peril, to the characters and their unique situations, rather than be gratuitous. With a diversity of stories & styles including; violent crime (Sonnies Edge / The Witness / Blindspot), war (Lucky 13 / The Secret War / Shape Shifters), comedy (When The Yogurt Took Over / Alternate Histories / Three Robots) and straight up classic Science Fiction (Ice Age / Helping Hand / Beyond the Aquila Rift / Fish Night) \"Love, Death & Robots\" leaves viewers wanting for nothing. If you don't like the current story/style, just wait 10 mins and the next one might be the best TV you have watched in ages. Original, dark, funny, thought provoking & action packed, as well as visually dissolving the barriers between live-action, animation and V-FX / CGI, this has got to be a cult classic already. Worth it for \"Zima Blue\" (animation), \"The Secret War\" (CGI), \"The Witness\" (WTF!) and \"Three Robots\" (dialogue), but I think my real favorite is 'the Yogurt'. Watch it, it's worth it.\n",
            "I've been waiting for something like this for so long. Compelling and well done short stories. Can't wait for season two!!\n",
            "I have only watched 3 episodes but the first one just made me glued to it. The story telling in just 18 mins is incredible. I wish episode 1 was a full series in its own. Did Not think this was what the series was about when I just clicked on it to see what it was. Reminds me of the abcs of death but less creppy and messed up and more about the story telling. If you love games and sci fi then this is for you\n",
            "It had been been a long time since Netflix unveiled something as exiting and original as this. At first, I was skeptical about the genre, since Iv'e never really been a fan of horror fiction. However, this TV show is so well made that it me change my mind.\n",
            "What makes it so special is how every episode's story is really unique and original. They even managed to include brilliant insights different social problems (obvious in the second episode\" the three robots\", where one of the robots tells the two others how the humans came to extinction).\n",
            "I also found that it was really interesting how they used different animation techniques for each episodes. Some of them look like they are taking places in video games, others are made by stop motion and the rest are similar to Disney movies.\n",
            "I'd really hope to see more TV shows like this in the future!\n",
            "Like some of the reviewers here, I was looking around when I came across this marvel.\n",
            "The stories, art and animation is superb!\n",
            "I was blown away by the fact that this is a series of stories set in the future, most having to do with robotics, and the STORIES they tell are SO RICH in entertaining! I LOVED this series!!! The ONLY reason I knocked the value down was, *Parents WATCH THESE EPISODES FIRST *!!! There were so many family friendly episodes, and then BOOM!!! an episode that i would DEFINITELY class as Rated X! That makes ZERO SENSE to include those in the same type of video compilation! This was such an excellent movie until then! Even the great segments after, were tainted because of the awful videos.\n",
            "I watched something this good and gripping for a whole. Amazing animation and story line. I watched the whole season in one sitting and I cannot wait for season 2\n",
            "Started the first episode just to see what it is all about.\n",
            "Couple of hours later i command you to binge watch this , it's excellent\n",
            "Well done Netflix, we need more like this !\n",
            "Just... purely amazing! There is one episode (beyond the Aquila rift) where I literally thought it was shot in real-life. The CGI was incredibly life-like. Beautifully animated throughout the whole series, and the stories are mind-blowing. There is always a twist, sometimes you kinda sorta know it but others completely came out of nowhere.\n",
            "Please please please let us see a second season.\n",
            "This series is amazing. It's thoughtful, surprising, sexy, and seriously addictive to watch. It reminds me of heavy metal mag from years ago. The variety of this anthology makes it superb. The artwork is fantastic and the story lines will draw you in and keep you begging for more.Please Netflix, give us more!\n",
            "Each episode has something to offer and nothing to take from the viewer..All of the episodes have excellent animation, that can be safely considered as a stand-alone success..To make matters best, the script & dialogues are genious, the plot is unbelievably complete and interesting for such short duration and the underlying messages are equally easy and hard to get\n",
            "This series is very well done. The CGI, animation, and stories grab your attention. Not sure why theres so much dick though...\n",
            "S03 did not disappoint.In my opinion great art, exciting storytelling. Get the sense that these are the kinds of things you get when you do not interfear with the creative team and their vision. Some episodes are really different from... anything. The only other show right now I would compare this to is Black mirror.\n",
            "The anthology animated series which is cool and completely awestruck.The visuals are so extermely pinnacle to the visual works which is exquisite and artistic (mature).Must watch animated shorts.\n",
            "Brilliant story lines and amazing twists with out of this world CGI beautifully made and must see\n",
            "The thing I love about netflix is that they are willing to take risks on productions like this. This show ended up being an amazing series that presents many concepts. Not all the episodes are all too good, but some of the episodes really are breathtaking.\n",
            "Specially the first episode and second , I would watch the hecka poop outta it ! But all that aside , give this a chance you WILL not regret it !\n",
            "Good animations, interesting storylines. I loved every part\n",
            "The series that came out of nowhere, tI leave me with my mouth open completely, it would really be little to say that the animation of these shorts is good, because it is simply fantastic. The episodes themselves treat a different story with a different style of animation, I must admit that not all the shorts were my taste and I even found them pretentious, but at no time they left me bored or waiting for more, the animation was incredible in each one of them, especially the last chapter, which I consider the best.Something quite new and unique, entertaining and of excellent quality.\n",
            "Incredible CGI with intelligent, outside the box thought provoking stories. I thoughoughly enjoyed this anthology.I will caution viewers though that it does get very graphic in parts and it is not intended for the Squeamish.\n",
            "If you like black mirror or reading short stories then this show is perfect for you.\n",
            "I really want a season 2\n",
            "This is the most beautiful animation I have ever seen. Each episode has it's own unique style, and the CGI and face renderings are completely natural. The narratives are easy to get absorbed into, and the short runtimes of each episode makes this anthology easy to binge. I could watch about 10,000,000 episodes of this show. Hopefully it wins some animation awards.\n",
            "This show is a sci-fi fans dream. This is now my favorite animated series. The art showcased here is absolutely breathtaking! The stories have some amazing sci-fi concepts that were a lot of fun. I really hope Netflix produces more of this type of content.\n",
            "Gorgeous animation and interesting stories even if some are similar to one another. I would have gave it 10, but I don't think it passed the Bechdel test even once, so I can't give it a perfect score. The stories have different tones and cover a lot of sub genres like steampunk, space opera, etc. Almost everery episode is an amazing experience, and I wish there were more.\n",
            "It was an incredible journey...every episode every character was outstanding and magnificent, animation 11/10 dialogue short but very smart and good,I want more from this series.\n",
            "Ahhh, the bob and the jaina, loved it these are some of the best animation you will ever see and the last one, damn, right attitude of war, race, reality, obedience and sacrifice. what would i not give to experience all this in one life time.\n",
            "Well worth a watch, never get boring as the various styles and plot lines keep you engaged. Some better than other but I'm glad I watch the series.\n",
            "Very clever set of animations that will appeal to sci fi fans across the board.You may not like every episode, and some use pretty standard tropes that border on cliché, but on the whole the subtext and plot twists are enough to keep you thinking.Very slick graphically for most, and the stories generally grab your attention pretty quickly. I really enjoyed the series... good work Netflix!\n",
            "This tv series has very good writing, good directing and the animation is very stunning. It's also very funny and sad at times and can really change your mood when watching all the episodes. My only problem with the series is that there is a lot of unnecessary nudity scenes, it gets uncomfortable at some points. Other then that you should watch this series if your bored. It will make you not bored.\n",
            "Such a great great great show everrrr . Everything they have done is perfect, blow me away\n",
            "Each episode is great in its own way. The anthology makes you want to see more, and the episodes are easy to get through. Great show all around.\n",
            "I did not know what to expect. Some are funny, some are harrowing, all are brilliant. I implore you to watch this. It is the best thing to hit Netflix in a long time.\n",
            "A fantastic mix of different animation style, each bringing its own flavour to the story.The feeling it gives is a mix of Animatrix and first episodes of Black Mirror, where you just watch in awe and can't possibly stop.Absolutely worth watching\n",
            "I stumbled upon this series while browsing the Netflix catalogue and started ep. 1 late in the evening. I ended up having watched all episodes in one go and in the very late hours of the night. Must see TV. Easily one of the best shows ever.\n",
            "I was Leary at first, the stories did a great job of pulling you in and keeping you inthrawled with each episode.\n",
            "Out of this world animation but nearly every episode is drenched in violence along side 'nothing' stories. Season 1 was best. The writers must very young as I refuse to believe mature people can write such shallow stuff!\n",
            "Very good series! fantastic work of art!\n",
            "beautiful drawing and graphics in multiple styles!\n",
            "congratulations to all! \"good hunting\"\n",
            "I honestly watched each episode one night and did not stop until the final credits ran.\n",
            "It's a game changer guys, you need to see this gem of Netflix ASAP and I promise you a wonderful experience and a never ending appetite for such stories presented in all kind of animations.\n",
            "It was a brave and bold move by Netflix to produce such show on the reliable shoulders of Tim Miller and hell it paid off well. All episodes are good and entertaining throughout but so far my favourites have been \"sonnie's edge\" \"three robots\" \"shape shifter\" \"helping hand\" and \"suits\".\n",
            "If this isn't the future tv series then what is??\n",
            "First episode makes me scream of emotions. Well done, exquisite animation, espectacular stories\n",
            "Terrifying creatures, wicked surprises and dark comedy converge in this NSFW anthology of animated stories presented by Tim Miller and David Fincher. An amazingly creative, fun range of subjects and settings ranging from intelligent cyberpunk sci-fi to creepy horror, one of the best Netflix originals in a while. Through stunning animation, the series illustrates surreal worlds and fantastical themes, and although at times the stories are hard to digest, they're certainly thought-provoking and worth discussing.\n",
            "This show is groundbreaking in a way that graduates nerd passions to a new level of awesomeness. Netflix is clearly not scared to tap into textures, storylines and out of the box formulas that redefine excellence in production. Bravo to Netflix who seems destined to be Leader in a new kind of vision.. I feel like a 10 year old kid that just discovered the shock and awe of Lord Vader. Awesome...\n",
            "Excellent! It's well written and unexpected. Animation is on point and comes in many styles. Takes a stab at all genres and comedy and nails it, just spent the whole day watching all episodes and couldn't help but think of how good it is\n",
            "Truly classic. One of the best by the best. Amazed!\n",
            "With the many styles of animation as well as the huge variety of story this series is a constantly unveiling surprise. The topics range from video-game like slashers, but always with a clever twist, to very funny vignettes to significant social commentary. I have enjoyed every episode immensely and I am still only about half-way through the series. I also like that they are short and sweet, only about 20min an episode, but so far each is a perfectly well-rounded story. If you love sci-fi and animation this series is gold.\n",
            "Roll overTom Swift and the Hardy boys! Tell Tchaikovsky the news. This series will blow your minds! Exquisite to say the very least!\n",
            "I really enjoyed the series and thought Netflix did a great job making each episode unique, not only with the story lines but the total presentation.\n",
            "Just watch it, you'll definitely like it!\n",
            "This series has simply blown my mind. I dont tend to rave too much these days about television shows so if I do it's something that's really stirred me enough to want to say something.\n",
            "I can't speak highly enough of this series. There's not one animated short I didn't love. There's a few stand outs but overall everyone was on point from the animation to the writing, each one delivers something unique and fresh.\n",
            "Stop what you're doing and watch this highly creative series, you won't be disappointed.\n",
            "I was so impressed that it made me come here half way through the episodes and just give it a 10/10. I had heard nothing about it and simply decided to check it out, turned out to be unexpetedly good! Interesting stories, mature unapologetic themes, amazing animation styles, humorous at times! You never know what to expect from the next episode. Just watch it and enjoy\n",
            "Loved every episode, would highly recommend watching\n",
            "This 18 short episode is funny, visceral, lusty, scary, and f'ing bloody adventure is something I did not know I needed. Every episode is so unique and imaginative it makes me wonder what drugs the author is on to create each of the amazing stories. I really hope Netflix comes with more seasons.Fyi this is NOT a family show.\n",
            "First of all kudos to the creators to make this beautiful series. Every single episode is full of entertainment, humor and awesomeness. I wish there were more of them but will wait for the next season.Dont think about it, just start watching and you will enter the awesomeness created by Netflix.\n",
            "A new anthology series by the ever experimental Netflix Love, Death, & Robots explores different genres of mainly scifi & fantasy with interesting stories & characters with the intensity cranked up to 110% Definitely NSFW very graphic, possibly not for anyone that doesn't like over the top violence but not all episodes are gory. But it's a definite show to check out from werewolf soldiers to sentient yogurt there's something for everyone.\n",
            "Loved this - probably the best thing I have watched on Netflix to date. Beautiful animation.\n",
            "All episodes were fun to watch, intriguing, and amazingly well done. My only small gripe was they seemed to show most nudity only because they could and sometimes it didn't make sense....and I love nudity.\n",
            "This needed to be done and I am so grateful. I live everything about it. While every so gle story didn't resonate , there are so many moments in the whole that took this series over the top.\n",
            "As much as I wanted more in season two, it's hard to not see this as beautiful in every way. Absolutely stunning visual art, music, voice acting, CGI (of course), and overall pure art in digital form. My hat is off to all of the creators of this masterpiece of a series.\n",
            "Animation is next level, the stories are weird and beautiful each short movie is better then the other and who ever created this show he has a twisted imagination this show is a solid 9 for me.\n",
            "Incredible short stories, well done and no topic is untouchable. Love this series, thank you Netflix for something truly original.\n",
            "If you loved the Animatrix series of short films, you will love this new collection of 18 dystopian future stories centering around technology. Different artists and styles for each story just like Animatrix.\n",

I love this animated series so much. I really hope that some of them can be made into independent real-life movies. In this way, I will be super super happy.\n",
            "Totally weird. Each episode runs for an average 15 mins, each one more freakier than the other.But help me, I really enjoyed most of them. It's like Tim Miller saying \"I don't care whether you like it or not. I will anyways make whatever I think. If you don't like it, it's not your cup of tea\".And the product came out surprisingly unique and dramatic. The animations are top notch, the imaginations are singular, the plots are bold.Will wait for more!\n",

I liked all episodes but personally didn't like some 2D which felt like old school cartoon. Some sort of imagination and fiction are really appreciated and somewhere 3D characters was so detailed and look like real human. I would definitely watch follow-up seasons. Also, I appreciate all the actors, writers and VFX animator guys for their absolute best performance. Somewhere I saw adult content that would probably should avoid so all can see on large screen together. I recommed to watch who has short amount of time and to eager to see climax.\n",

            "Love, Death and Robots is the most amazing show in animation quality that Netflix released in 2019. Eighteen episodes, each one with a different story. The unique connection is the fact that some episodes are about love, some about death and others about robots.Not every episode is a winner. Some of them provide an awesome visual, but the story is not so entertaining. And some of them have a story full of creative designs.My \"you should watch\" are 1x02 \"Three robots\", 1x12 \"Fish Night\", 1x17 \"Alternate Histories\" and 1x03 \"The Witness\" because they both have amazing visuals and a intriguing story.\n",
            "Some episodes that I personally didn't enjoy that much were 1x06 \"When Yogurt Took Over\" and 1x09 \"The Dump\"I recommend you to watch at least one episode or two. Is lovely to see that Netflix absolutely is an excellent place for creative animation\n",
            "An anthology of short adult animated films, Love, Death & Robots proves adept at communicating the ability of animation to visualize and portray all kinds of stories. Each episode is an adaptation of a short story or novella broadly falling under one or more of the three themes that are spelled out by the series' title. Realized by a consortium of animation studios, an impressive array of art and animation styles are used to bring to life the episodes' content.There is a vast variety to the stories selected in this anthology. Some of the vignettes like \"The Witness\", \"Zima Blue\", \"Pop Squad\", \"The Drowned Giant\", \"Bad Travelling\" and \"Swarm\" are profound and thought-provoking with metaphorical interpretations or philosophical underpinnings. Others such as \"Three Robots\", \"Alternate Histories\" and \"Night of the Mini Dead\" are light-hearted or humorous. Episodes like \"Sonnie's Edge\", \"The Secret War\", \"Snow in the Desert\" and \"In Vaulted Halls Entombed\" are examples of visually-captivating worldbuilding. Reimagined folk tales and local legends get their share of the spotlight through \"Sucker of Souls\", \"Good Hunting\", \"All Through the House\" and \"Jibaro\". Space settings are notably present in \"Beyond the Aquila Rift\", \"Helping Hand\", \"Life Hutch\" and \"The Very Pulse of the Machine\" with \"Suits\", \"Automated Customer Service\" and \"Mason's Rats\" showcasing mechs and robotics, for good or bad. There are more episodes, but this should suffice to convey the range and diverse nature of the content on offer.I do feel that as of yet, even if there is a lot of adult imagery and mature narratives, the theme of Love hasn't been explored very deeply. There are also dips and troughs in the quality, particularly with Season 2 as a whole being less compelling than Season 1, perhaps due to a reduced number of episodes. Season 3 is better than its predecessor but the stories still feel a little lacking.But nonetheless, Love, Death & Robots is a must-watch for any lover of animation. Each episode is a unique experience with its own blend of artistry and storytelling that will more often than not enamour and entertain its audience.\n",
            "Very nice for people that like animation. To me, the episode \"Witness\" was a really interesting one.\n",

            "Typically not my style but was swayed by the good reviews. Was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the change of pace. Some episodes are meh, but on the whole, was solid.Was a mix between black mirror, video game cut scenes, and a series of moral lessons.\n",
            "This is probably the most under-rated show ever! I haven't heard anyone talk about it or the show making any kind of buzz online but I have to say the out of the box ideas and stunning looks of the show and the story telling everthing was just perfect. A few episodes didn't land properly but other than that the show manges to blow your mind in every single episoed. Considering most episodes are of 20 minutes only and yet they mange to blow your mind thats just great. I have immense respect for this show!\n",
            "Netflix - every year begins to amaze more and more for the better! Promoting your projects as future ones that haven't even come out yet and how those who already capture the hearts of many fans! So back to the show \"Love, death and robots\"\"Love, death and robots\" is a series with short series and each with its own plot. This is a huge plus, because no one has done this before. Each series has its own genre: This is both horror and fantasy, comedy and action, adventure with fantasy elements or in one of the series you will find - it's all together!I will try now to list you a few pros and cons that I saw in this series:Let's start with the pros:1) Top quality drawing2) The soundtrack is also at the highest level, the music is generally well chosen for each series, which helps to transfer to that small short film world that we are shown.3) Each episode has some small meaning.There are many advantages of this series and I am sure that they will each have their own as well as minuses about which I will also write now1) Very short if you even stretch the pleasure of viewing, then it will be enough for 2 evening views2) Not all the series are as bright as it seems at first glance, when you review 2 times already, it seems that this series is very unsuccessful, for example, the last but one series for me remained some kind of a fly in the ointment, it feels like it was painted under the drugs, it seems to be a good idea, and the drawing style can be called copyright, but the authors smoked when they were painted by no one knowsIf you sum up, then you ask yourself whether it is worth advising someone to watch this series. Definitely worth it, even the most worth reviewing it, perhaps more than once, if not to consider something new for yourself, then just to get pleasure from viewing in a good company at home, or alone10 out of 10Enjoy watching!P.S. This is my opinion, which has the right to life! If you ask what series I liked and I will recommend to watch that 1 4 7 8 13 series sunk into my soul more than others\n",
            "Some very unique and interesting stories told in this series which may not be possible in movies, S2 is average but S1 was very good.\n",
            "In the space of animated fantasy, anything is possible. In this hyper-masculine dark fantasy world, the use of female bodies for soft porn sex and abusive violence are front and center, starting right off in the very first episode, and in many thereafter. If you're enjoying the lush and charged visual aesthetics, I can understand that, because it's really well designed. Dark fantasy can be compelling and charged, and there's definitely a satisfying place for that in the human psyche.What I'd ask you to think about is how this show quite literally uses virtual (3D animation models) women's bodies in all the ways that hard porn does. It grabs on and glorifies all of the \"male gaze\" stereotypes that are clearly NSF soft porn. The majority of hetero male porn reflects the more toxic aspects of the insecure male issues with power and control over women. Those insecure males need to push it onto and into female bodies, treating those bodies like objects and containers used for service. It's applied in isolated, fantasy spaces in order to support the psychological manifestation of power that converts to physical and mental pleasure. 'Love, Death & Robots' adheres and reinforces this toxic male perspective so frequently that it becomes a significant part of the project, and this is a problem. Netflix and the show's producers, writers, directors, designers, modellers, texture artists, riggers, storyboard artists and animators are all making choices about how to keep perpetuating porn standards for females.\n",
            "What a great serie i loved it every chapter is a whole new roller coster of emotion\n",
            "My personal opinion is that this show is absolutely mind blowing and I JUST LOVE IT ! 100% makes u feel alive even tho it's animated , love it , try it rn.\n",
            "Usually animated shows are something one would love or hate. But this anthology is like a perfect steak in a sense that it's really really rare, bloody and something everyone (18+) can enjoy.\n",
            "Dark, twisted entertainment, with fantastic (varied) animation. What's not to love about this series. Good job Netflix, let's have some more like this.\n",
            "Review up to season 2.\"Love, Death and Robots\" is an amazing anthologic series. Episodes are short, between 10 and 20 minutes, and are autoconclusive. Every episode has a different animation style, from photorealistic, to more abstract and toony techniques. It is a show for your eyes. Some stories are more action based, others are more on the philosophical side and criticize modern society, reminding a little bit \"Black Mirror\", while other are simply funny. There are some episodes that are very difficult to understand, even if you watch them multiple times. I have debated for hours with my friends about the real meaning of many of these chapters. This is a show that manage to involve you and make you pay attention. There are no narrative wastes, with useless details, the short runtime formula, works perfectly and you can easily watch five or six installments on a row, without even noticing.I have however some small complaints: most of these stories are set on a post apocalyctic and dystopian worlds, which is a setting that I really love, but I would like to have more variety on locations and concepts. Some of these episodes are aesthetic over content, an excercise of style, with no plot at all, which is a little bit pointless. For the rest, I have to say that I am very pleased that Netlix released a series like this one. If you are into animation, this is something that you need to watch. One of the few show worth to spend time on, in this ocean of garbage that is produced nowadays.\n",
            "If you love animation as I do then this is most defiantly a must must must see. Up to this point I had always preferred the Japanese' (specifically \"Studio Ghibli\") as my \"Go Too\" animation and the ones to watch. This Netflix collection has a wide range of stiles and Im sure will meet everyone's taste. You will never watch badly drawn cartoons (South park, Simpsons etc...) again.\n",
            "\"Love, Death, + Robots\" features stellar animation in all of it's episodes and features stories that are nicely resolved in a quick time frame. When this show is good it is amazing, with some of the most beautiful animation and imaginative stories. Episodes like \"Zima Blue\" and \"Pop Squad\" stand out as fantastic through the expressive animation and bold storytelling. But then there are some episodes that leave a bad taste in my mouth. Episodes such as \"The Junkyard\" and \"The Witness\" lack proper stories and follow very annoying and unlikeable characters. Then there are the over sexualized shots and scenes featuring characters that only serve the purpose of being eye candy. It usually doesn't work and can be very gross and disturbing. But once you can look past these episodes you will be met with a stupendous show filled with heart, amazing animation, and great stories.\n",
            "Every episode is great. I've been able to watch 9 episodes so far and they've been great. Using different drawings made it unique. I really liked the Second, Sixth and Seventh episodes. My favorite part was 8, as I love Chinese and Japanese culture and style. I felt a bit they inspired by League of Legends. Especially the woman in episode 8 was like Ahri. Revenge, fox, technology, magic and china.. combined very well. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the series for creating such a beautiful production.\n",
            "Wow!! The animation style is amazing. But unfortunately I can't watch more because even each episode is short, I still like anthology like what Black Mirror did. That is one great point that being string of each episode.\n",
            "I heard good reviews until I've watched it myself. This is beyond Greatness.. Animation, Story, Acting, Characters, Soundtrack, Everything in it such a Masterpiece.\n",
            "I highly, highly recommend Love, Death & Robots. Easily one of my favorite shows of all time, and I am so, so happy it's been approved for a third season.The animation is always on point. Some episodes are absolutely beautiful masterpieces. There are some very creative ideas and storylines. Some episodes had me in tears, others had me gasping in shock. Plenty of variety. The whole thing was an emotional rollercoaster.Everyone seems to have extremely different reactions to each of the episodes, as is extremely apparent by every ranking list I've seen so far. So just try to go in with an open mind and just experience them all. If you know you're particularly sensitive to a certain theme (the violence and/or nudity can be very intense at times), I'd recommend looking that up in advance.The second season was a bit of a disappointment. It felt like the creators had listened a bit too much to the critics, and it's ended up really watered down. But in spite of that, this show has barely dropped at all, in my eyes. There are still absolutely fantastic episodes, and they are still absolutely worth a watch. Who knows, you might really love them.Either way, go watch it! Fingers crossed for third season.\n",
            "The reaction to this show has been exceptional in botht ht epositive and negative. I am more surprised with the negative reaction than I thought possible since it surprises me. People seem to take issue with the gratuitous nudity or the protrayal of violence in association with women in this series which makes me wonder if I watched the same series as the critics. I didn't see any victims in this show, I saw survivors and strong women being portrayed in ways that were very creative. Beyond my issues with the critics I think this show is phenomenal. How it portrayed a dystopian future or advanced technology and civilization in ways I haven't seen in a very long time is remarkable. The only negative thing I could say about this show is that the episode Ice Age was definitely the weakest and I wonder if it could have been better without the flesh and blood human actors portrayed on screen. If you are on the fence about this show let me help you decide, go watch it now, watch it with an open mind and no preconception, and above all just have fun watching it.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots is an adult animated anthology television series that airs on Netflix. It has a collection of animated short stories consisting of various different genres in each episode.Season 1:\n",
            "In its first season, Love, Death & Robot has 18 episodes that are unique, wild, dangerous, full of action, suspense, horror, full of bloody scenes, crazy and of course amazing. The story in each episode is different seasoned with amazing visual effects. If we pay attention, the visuals displayed use different animations, ranging from computer visuals to animations from CGI effects that almost look real. The first season of Love, Death & Robots that did not disappoint. Various scenes do appear vulgarly, boldly and present a different atmosphere. A unique story with great conflict and meaning. This first season presents its own sensation and experience in enjoying this series. One of the best episodes for me was Zima Blue.Season 2:\n",
            "The second season ran with 8 episodes. Still with the same concept as the first season, from the visuals to the story. For me, this second season has a deep meaning for understanding human nature. Might want to elevate and explore the underside and character of the human being. Some episodes have the meaning of life with shades of the human ego. As in the episode Pop Squad which looks at humans who have developed on their thinking. Also in the episode Automated Customer Service which shows that how bad and lazy humans are when they have experienced a period of technological sophistication.Season 3:\n",
            "The third season which ran with 9 episodes. For this time, many episodes present scenes with bloodshed or bring out actions full of cruelty, brutality to bleed. This third season is a bit of a stretch for me compared to the previous two seasons. Dark impressions can also be felt in this series. However, it does not close that this season is still fairly good. It has a new and fresh story, prioritizing fast-paced actions like in the episode Kill Team Kill. This third season is still with good visuals. Stories and conflicts can indeed be said to be full of bloodshed.\n",
            "All episodes in the show are not consistent, which is one of the reasons why it's so great. There are a plethora of stories that you heavily get sucked into watching without the feeling of stopping. You can binge for a day because they're all under 20min. This is unfortunate, but the show is still very captivating. I cannot stress this enough when I say to watch the show!\n",
            "An animated collection reminiscent of Liquid Television that aired on MTV in the early 1990s, LDRobots also feels similar to the anthology, \"Spirited: 13 Haunting Tales,\" by Leap Books. The subject matter goes beyond what anybody could expect from standard television programming, and it examines a variety of themes from horror to science fiction to the paranormal.There is some humor, albeit off color, as in \"Alternate Histories,\" a look at Adolph Hitler's death under a variety of divergent circumstances. As unlikely as a squid landing on the moon, the animated short blasts a cascade of ideas for the viewer to consider in a fashion very similar to LDRobots as a whole. Individually, the animated shorts manage to hit the screen, one after another, feeling original in scope and context to the point of being outlandish.Many segments feel like treatments for feature-length films. The volume and quality of actors lending their talents to the works demonstrate how serious an undertaking the originators were as blueprints for the project were being drawn. Especially in \"Sonnie's Edge,\" blending the vocal talent of relative newcomer Hayley McLaughlin (Deadly Switch, Netflix) with the experience of Time Winters (Metal Gear Solid V, Sneakers) and many others to craft a story of fantasy-combat that could succeed as a graphic novel, video game or animated film. There are so many layers to the epic story, it's 17-minute runtime just scratches the surface.If LDRobots has a flaw, it's brevity. Almost every short left me grimacing at the abbreviated length. As of this writing in early 2020, Netflix hints that another volume is coming. It helps a bit, leaving me to watch \"The Secret War,\" an almost 17-minute whirlwind of Red Army soldiers engaged in one-quarters combat with croaking demons in Siberia. The story cuts me off like a dealer holding out on a junkie just when the action is at fever pitch. The screen goes black and I want to fling the remote in anger. I just wanted a little more.\n",
            "This is an anthology show that covers scifi, urban myth and fantasy. Each episode covers a unique and different story from one another. The scifi stories in all three seasons were good and intriguing with deep emotions, which suits the title \"Love, Death & Robots.\" I am not interested in seeing episodes based on urban legend or myth, which contradicts the title. The episodes \"Zima Blue,\" \"Pop Squad,\" and \"Bad Traveling\" were my favorite ones from the show. But still, few episodes were underwhelming and boring, despite the short length of the episode. The uniqueness of animation in each episode was admirable, and it was an addon to create an interest in the art style. The writing was good enough to give quality content in a short time span. The music was good. In conclusion, I loved this show. I would recommend everyone to watch this show.\n",
            "Each episode is Unique and exciting. Many stories have charecters that remain in our mind for a while.excellent addition to sci fi genre.\n",
            "First things first I love crude humor. And I love dark humor. I just find this series too presuming, too confident in it's pretentious ideas.Though it looks great and the production values in general are very, very admirable.\n",
            "Love this show.... I wonder was season 2 is so short. I wish it was longer.. Great episodes. Great variety. Definitely kept my attention!\n",
            "I absolutely loved every single episode, I never ever wanted it to end. The bizzareness was on point, the feeling of unease, but being completely mesmerized at the same time, was a unique and very enjoyable combination to experience. What a show, I wish there was more of this.\n",
            "Sure, Death lures around the corner in various ways in each episode, but it's funny, it's confronting, and boy is it a thrilling ride!\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots is a groundbreaking anthology series that boldly explores the intersections of science fiction, horror, and dark humour through a variety of visually stunning and thematically rich short films. Each episode stands alone, offering viewers a unique blend of storytelling styles and animation techniques that push the boundaries of traditional narrative and visual artistry.The show's greatest strength lies in its variety. With each episode crafted by different creators, it presents a kaleidoscope of artistic visions and narrative approaches, ranging from hyper-realistic CGI to experimental, stylised art. This creative freedom results in a captivating array of stories, each exploring profound themes such as the human condition, technological evolution, and the darker aspects of love, death, and robotics. The anthology format ensures that no two episodes feel alike, making every instalment a fresh and unpredictable experience.Episodes like Beyond the Aquila Rift and Zima Blue stand out for their emotional depth and philosophical undertones, showcasing the series' ability to delve into thought-provoking territory. These episodes transcend their animated format, delivering narratives that linger in the mind and invite reflection. In contrast, high-energy episodes like Sonnie's Edge highlight the series' flair for intense, action-packed storytelling, proving its versatility in both tone and pacing.However, the anthology's diversity is also its Achilles' heel. Not every episode achieves the same level of impact, and some feel more like visual showcases than fully realised stories. While the inconsistency is a natural byproduct of the format, it can occasionally disrupt the overall experience. Despite this, the series' ambition and creativity consistently shine through, offering moments of brilliance that outweigh its weaker entries.Visually, Love, Death & Robots is nothing short of spectacular. Its cutting-edge animation and innovative designs set a new standard for the medium, making it a feast for the eyes as well as the mind. The freedom given to the creators ensures that the visuals are as varied and daring as the narratives, further enhancing the series' appeal.In conclusion, Love, Death & Robots earns its place as a standout in the world of animated anthologies. Its bold storytelling, stunning animation, and exploration of provocative themes make it a unique and exhilarating viewing experience. While some episodes may fall short, the series as a whole offers an unforgettable journey through the imaginative and the extraordinary, proving that animation can be as profound and boundary-pushing as any live-action medium.\n",
            "It was amazing to watch all these different animations full of crazy stuff and dark humor. Amazing graphics, good dialogs and always another plot keept me watching the series. You might be wondering about the 18+, but it only helps the series to remain unique. 100% recommendation!\n",
            "I watch the first episode and thought this was brilliant, these funny, witty robots walking around a destroyed earth trying to understand human life and their existence. The next two were pretty good as well, I liked the ice age one. However, the episodes that followed after were totally not to my liking and then I gave up. They became about wars, fighting, blood, guts, slimy monsters, no thanks! But if you like those sorts of things then you'll probably would enjoy this.\n",
            "This anthology gives the best of CGI/graphics with some looking so real I had to Google whether it was actual graphics or not (I'm talking the episode with Michael B Jordan)...either way, the original stories and plotlines (that range so much) are absolutely fascinating. Some are so captivating they act as a trailer to a movie you really wanna see! I've loved both series and only hope they continue to make more.\n",
            "We should be thankful for Netflix. No, really, we should. They are taking all risks to produce their own content. Sometimes they fail and sometimes they make wonderful things: like Love, Death & Robots.Each episode it's interesting in it's own way, with rich stories and animations of different styles. Every episode it's pure gold.Thanks Netflix, you did my weekend better!\n",
            "Look at the cover and all you see is an animation and something that contains a NSFW tag. Look beneath and you see a combination of unique animations, compelling stories and so much more! Every episode pulls you into its story and it's unique animation leaves you in awe. It's an absolute beauty and a must watch. But beware it is not for the faint of heart.\n",
            "The whole series was masterpiece with some really wonderful, thoughtful inputs. For me Suits was the best episode of the whole series because of action and amazing twisted ending.\n",
            "I liked every episode and enjoyed the action,comedy and thriller of this series. The best part was the creativeness of this series with really awesome work. At many place I was shocked to see such a wonderful work which is far more better than anywhere else.\n",
            "Through stunning animation, the series illustrates surreal worlds and fantastical themes, and although at times the stories are hard to digest, they're certainly thought-provoking and worth discussing.\n",
            "Every story is gripping and different. Loved it.Every short story was different from other also the best part is the animation they have tried different set of technologies for each story which makes every story completely different from other. Felt like they are competing with each other and trying to make their few minutes story to stand out from others. This deserves your time.Loved all the stories and the plot. Animations also looked very high tech and something that they have really worked on in each field be it story, characters, music, animation, dialogues, the beginning and the end.\n",
            "It's an anthology so some might not be as good as others but there is certainly something for everyone. Except kids this show is extreme in some of the episodes. Absolutely cant wait for the next season\n",
            "This was so incredibly good. Reminded me of Black Mirror except with more action and explosions. We need a second season right away Netflix!\n",
            "One of the best Netflix originals .. I hope they will NEVER stop production. One, two, three or even 10 seasons won't be enough. 😭😭😭😍😍😍\n",

            "💯/💯\n",
            "\"Love, Death & Robots\" is an interesting show, it's filled with a collection of short episodes that have unique stories. Each episodes the characters and their stories change, but the animation is flawless. The textures look realistic and how they interact with the environment is lovely, the sound design is amazing too. But again, the animation, whilst watching the show I never noticed a dip in quality, each episode is filled with so much detail that keeps you engaged and that's how you get hooked. The voice actors have done an amazing job too at bringing these characters to life and giving the story more depth.\n",
            "I enjoyed watching this show although not every episode have a meaning behind it, but there were a couple of awesome episodes with bigger meanings.\n",
            "Overall a very enjoyable experience.\n",
            "20 minutes per episode will blow your mind! I binged watching this show till 3am. 2019s biggest surprise\n",
            "Just finished the 2nd season. Oddly enough, I liked the first episode the least and thought this season wasn't going to meet last seasons expectations.But after 'ice' (by far my favourite episode) my worries were gone.Like last season, some episodes are clearly better than others, depending on one's taste. But that is partially why the show has such an appeal. So when rating this series I tend to look more at the episodes that i found most appealing. And then this series is a solid 8/10. If i had to rate the series overall, I would lean more on a 6.5/10, but that just doesn't do this series justice.8/10: really good.\n",
            "Whatever you say about this series will be a bit. All the episodes are amazing.You need some time to understand that it's animation and not regular actors.Amazing job.\n",
            "Seeing the David Fincher as producer of the series, you feel confident that something good has been created.\n",
            "The future of cinema?Maybe...\n",
            "If one thing justifies the subscription charges of Netflix, its a show like this.I started and watched all 18 episodes in one go. Rarely happens, but it did.Every episode is a gem, with a different story, a different technique of animation.Its like watching an animated short story version of Black Mirror (another show which I truly admire).If I had to rate this show and its individual episodes. it would start from exceptional to above average; nothing and absolutely nothing less than above average.The bar has been set with this one.\n",
            "Waiting for the next season.\n",
            "So when a person like myself who is not a comic con fanatic and is absolutely amazed and Impressed with this series. It speaks volumes for the creator and artists. They did just a superb job directed for adult content IMO.I look forward to their future endeavors and season 2. Netflix has a winner in this summer TV series.\n",
            "Medley of sci-fi short stories stands outs primarily thanks to its variety: in tone, in mood, in duration, in genre, in animation. Indeed Love, Death & Robots entrance you by the fact that you don't know what to expect. Love story in nickelodeon style animation? CGI action full of gore? Abstract painting philosophical thriller? Animation on its own worths sincere praise: quality of the picture is astounding, as well as style. To be honest, I didn't even know that computer graphic progressed so far. Characters from, for example, Sonnie's Edge or Beyond the Aquila Rift feels very very real.Unfortunately, diversity is the only bright side of the show. There are 18 episodes and only 1 of them (Good Hunting) brings novelty to the table, story-wise. Of the remaining 17 half is bluntly bad and the other half is built upon some cliche foundation. Yes, I liked this other half because I like to watch these deep spaces horrors, machine-turn-human-ballads, cyberpunk worlds, cosmonaut survivals, robots-explore-human-culture comedies, etc. but the fact is that such stories are totally unoriginal as even I, amateur viewer, have seen them all before, and not even once. I agree, that maybe it was artistic intent to convey the mood sci-fi circles by bringing to viewer the most earnest stories, the stories where we can feel the soul of the author, his passion. But soul and passion is present in any fanfic work and, well, it is what the stories of Love, Death & Robots are - fanfics.\n",
            "The account of thought they put in this is amazing.\n",
            "Every episode was MIND blowing, and I did not expect that.. this show is just superb! Whoever wrote the stories is simply a prodigy, also the animation, the styles, the designs were all excellent, to be honest I don't have a single bad thing to say about this anthology, it was all beyond brilliant and genius! DEFINITELY A MUST SEE!!\n",
            "We want more of these short movies! Every single one is brilliant.Can't belive I came across this just by chance. This stuff needs more advertise!Edit 2022: and again this series does not disappoint. Please never stop producing seasons of Love, Death & Roboths. It's the best stuff on Netflix! Love it!\n",
            "Stunning quality not just on the art department, scripts are top notch.\n",
            "It is hard to get one as a favourite, all of them are good on their own style and story telling.\n",
            "This series should have more awards!\n",
            "While the second season didn't add as much good stories as I hoped (which makes sense, it's not even half as long as season 1), Love, Death & Robots still remains a great series,\n",
            "which is capable of telling great stories with depth and meaning, but also just showing off funny ideas, in great & varying animation styles,\n",
            "all in the span of less than 20 min each.Easily recommended.\n",
            "This show made me laugh, think and consider the rise of automation in our society.\n",
            "Almost all of the shorts are cgi showoffs with a pseudo deep story.\n",
            "You can see the resemblance to black mitror without any thoughtfull storywriting.\n",
            "For most episodes you could tell the whole story from the first minute including the twists its just so predictable.\n",
            "It looks very good tho so 3 stars.\n",
            "There's a few episodes that I don't enjoy as much, but they are few and far between. This is an incredible series, with consistent high production value. The storylines are gripping and unique. There's a lot of violence and bleakness, but in a way that feels true to human nature.Alberto Mielgo's episodes are my favourite offerings on the show. He made \"the Witness\" in season 1, and \"Jibaro\" in season 3.He was the original director for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and everything I loved most about that movie was his brain baby and shines again in the Witness and Jibaro. He has a confident looseness in his character creation style that's just mesmerising.If you want to check out only one of these series of shorts, I recommend checking out Jibaro.\n",
            "Most reviewers are finally in agreement...this series REALly deserves the praise it's getting...already in its third season with many more, hopefully, to come...\n",
            "stories...animation...even the comedy is good. And sure, not ALL of them are great, but the ones that are MORE than make up for the ones that are, in any way, lacking...\n",
            "most of the ones i watch, somewhere along the way i have to remember my mouth, hanging open in amazement at just how good these are. I'm kind of surprised that some of the other cable networks haven't tried to copy the (varied) format. You'd think they'd want a piece of the action...\n",
            "in any case, i hope this series continues for a long time...something to look forward to, yearly.\n",
            "The best word to describe this is: unique.\n",
            "But not unique in any bad way. The stories are so brave and special. Every episode has its own story and is about 10-15 minutes long. If you whached a couple of them you are most likely to be hooked. But after some really well written stories you'll find yourself watching some episodes that are not as great as others. But still those feel unique and still really entertaining. The show is often graphic and it's really going to some dark places. Dystopian narratives as they should be. Definitely recommend!\n",
            "The last ten years have been full of reboots and repetitions. There is something really new here. Ideas and concepts that take the mind a little further. That's great.\n",
            "It's a very long time ago, that I could watch such a nice stuff. High quality made pieces, never boring, simply astonishing. I want more of this!!\n",
            "These animation shorts are packed with action and style. Each has a distinct animation style and draws you into its own atmosphere and emotion.The storytelling is TIGHT! These are short, 10-15 minutes but the stories and atmosphere are so distilled that it leaves you almost shell shocked. Some episodes are gratuitous action, some are horror, some lean to comedy or cyberpunk or film noir. For me, the most striking episodes are the ones that ooze horror (In Vaulted Halls Entombed, Bad Travelling), and the ones that are abstract and almost poetic (The Very Pulse of the Machine, Zima Blue, Jibaro). There's a number of these shorts that are more stimulating and memorable than many full-length movies, probably because the short form allows the creators to take risks and pack more creativity that any big budget production would allow.\n",
            "Sex, Splater and short strong storys with allways a new kind of artstyle. I was adicted to the Series. Its on a Level like Rick & Morty. I like more, mutch more and hope the next seasson has 20+ Episodes.\n",
            "The first season was done very well although I didnt really enjoyed the theme of love in all 3 seasons in most of the episodes. All the stories in the first season were well written and explored interesting ideas along with the engaging story line. Not many master the element of writing short stories and I should credit all the writers for their amazing work in season 1\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I'm an impatient viewer in the sense that I can't watch series that are long or have multiple seasons because when I start an interesting story I am super curious about the finale. Indeed I prefer movies or miniseries because I know that I have the free time to watch it all in a day without having to wait multiple days before I can finish it. And that's what brought me to this \"Love, Death & Robots\", indeed all the episode are short stories that are maximum 17 minutes long. The surprising thing is that all the episodes were not a waste of time and I appreciate all of them, clearly I loved some and others were instead a mere ok. But it was great to open a episode and having an entertaining short story to watch. The serie is all animated and technically fantastic, with some episodes that has a realistic 3D CGI and others that experiments more with some more artistic realisation. The other great aspect of \"Love, Death & Robots\" is the diversity of the stories because there are for all the tastes: action, thriller, horror vibes, monsters, sci-fi , war and surrealism are all present. Even the scopes are very different: some episodes want to teach a moral, others have the only scope to entertain, there are a few displays of style and some satirical ones.\n",
            "In conclusion I really really liked this serie and I think that everyone will appreciate something different about it. A must watch on Netflix.\n",
            "I don't understand some people give low rating, it is at least a 8. Some people think the stories too shallow, how do you manage to put a lot of idea together within 20minutes and try to be extremely profound? It is like blame the restaurant don't give you stainless fork and knives and champagne while you eating a plate of delicious fries. I think every episode is thoughts provactive more or less. I enjoyed every one of them. Overall, it is really good experiment on different genres of animations and themes, the stories are short enough to avoid letting you get bored and keep you interested, and they are also of great cinematic hype with excellent quality of animation. I hope Netflix can do more of this, let more directors and writer show off their ideas, good or bad, as long as it is short, lol.\n",
            "Some episodes are a bit dull, but i wouldn't miss them for a second. Each and every one worth a watch.Some of them were just stunning in animation and story line and i would love to see them as a full movie or series 😍\n",
            "I've never seen the trailers or heard of Love, Death + Robots, but everybody was talking about it and so I decided to give it a watch. I was already hooked on the direction it was going for, I didn't expected to be much like Black Mirror but I'm not complaining. Volume 1 was the most unique season I've ever watched. I love the different animation styles, how dark each plot is, and has a little twist to it. It was just brilliant to observe the visuals and original ideas.Volume 2 was a bit different from Volume 1. The animations were cool and there are some things I do enjoy from each episode, but it just wasn't the same which was quite disappointing. Volume 1 seems like it was going all out while Volume 2 was toned down which was a bore. Nevertheless, I do enjoy this show a lot and hope to see more in the future.\n",
            "Introduction:\n",
            "I can claim with copious amounts of clear confidence, that there is no show that's anything like \"Love, Death and Robots\". And it's a show that I absolutely love. While not as good as similar series, such as, \"The Twilight Zone\" or \"Black Mirror\", 'Love, Death and Robots\" is still a respectable series.The Stories:\n",
            "\"Love, Death and Robots\" is an anthology series, that tells the many different stories, that span many different genres: such as, science fiction, fantasy, horror, and comedy. However, this is not a show for everybody, the violence is at an all time high in this anthology, and the same goes for the sex and nudity, just know the first episode will shock you. And while I am usually not the kind of person for self-indulgent gore and sex for the sake of shock value, I think this show knows how to use that technique.Every episode feels so different from each other, that by watching just two episodes of the show, it would feel like you're watching two different series. The episodes are all different lengths, one could be twenty minutes, and one could be ten minutes. And while not all the stories hit, the ones that do, really do.From great comedic writing, to great world building, to characters you instantly fall in love with and grow attached to. So here are in my opinion the best episode of the series: my favorites are \"Three Robots\", \"The Witness\", \"Zima Blue\", \"Fish Night\", \"Sonnie's Edge\", \"Beyond the Aquila Rift\", \"When the Yogurt Took Over\", and \"The Secret War\".The Animation:\n",
            "Every episode has a different and unique animation style. Which really adds to the originality of the show. It is the hardest thing for me to choose what I think which episode is the best animated. But if I had to choose, I think the best style belongs to \"The Witness\", as it has a sort of comic book style with sound-effect words that pop up on the screen, and resembles \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\", but in my opinion, the style to this one is better. Because some backgrounds and shots of this short, look real. And \"The Witness\" isn't the only one. \"Good Hunting\" has a style that resembles a cross between American and Japanese styles of animation, something that resembles Avatar: The Last Airbender\". And I could ramble on all day about the amazing animation.The Characters:\n",
            "This show is able to create such interesting characters in under twenty minutes. A good example of what I'm talking about is in \"Zima Blue\". The main character in that story is a depressed artist, who feels unfulfilled with life. And by the end finds purpose, not in the money and power he processes as a successful artist, but rather doing a simpler job, that doesn't get him nearly as much recognition. And the same goes for most of the other characters in this anthology.Conclusion:\n",
            "If you are not a fan of shocking imagery and copious amounts of gore or sex, this show is not for you. But if you can get passed that, and enjoy the interesting stories, well, give it watch. I promise you will love it. It might be a show made for you, but it's a show made for me.\n",
            "I haven't finished the season yet, only about 5 episodes in but just had to come here to rave about this show! Each episode is only between 5 and 10 minutes or so but each one takes you on a crazy ride which sometimes makes you wish lasted longer just so you can see more of the world.The art is PHENOMENAL as well as the musical score. The writing is witty, interesting, funny, emotional and just a giant rollercoaster of emotions. Some episodes are funny, some sad and some just messed up and full of adrenaline. I also particularly like how each episode has a different art style. One had real actors, one was all cartoon, another was like a mixture of CGI/cartoons over real video (I think.. It looked way too real to not be... Think waking life for the style!).Each episode so far seems to have something to do with technology whether it be a futuristic dystopian setting, robots, VR, etc... It all has to do with technology (even if it's sometimes very subtle). I saw another article that stated people are comparing this show to Black Mirror but more intense. I could definitely see where they would get that. It does have the whole black mirror vibe and it is an anthology series.Definitely give this show a go. Watch a few episodes. If you don't like it after 2 or 3 it probably isn't for you.\n",
            "Some of the episodes are okay but the animation is what the japanese have been doing for the last 20 years so it's only really amazing if you are an american who has never watched manga or anime. Most of the stories include a fair bit of graphic violence and lots of swearing so that's also something that a lot of young people seem to think make shows better these days but overall it's okay. I would maybe watch one or three episodes again but that's about it\n",
            "A rich collection of short movies thematically sharing some commonalities and as a whole sharing amazing production value and somewhat interesting storytelling. All the episode are almost completely computer animated and the art is absolutely gorgeous and spellbinding. The colors are beautiful, the animation outstanding. And while some may fall short depending on ones preferences, it's hard to argue anyone would dislike all of them. Whether you like space, robots, monsters or crazy and mind-bending narratives, you will probably find something interesting. Some episodes are truly great but in general the quality and fantasy hits some peaks and lows with a few episodes of just pure action which, while still incredibly well produced, don't really provide the engaging narratives found in some others.\n",
            "Overall it's a brilliant series. Technically marvelous. Definitely recommandable and easily digestible, being that most episodes don't hit the 15 minutes mark.\n",
            "I love this kind of stuff. Very reminiscent of the 80's classic Heavy Metal. More adult animation like this please!!\n",
            "Every story is well created and worth the watch.Diverse stories, nice mix.\n",
            "The variety of different styles of animation shown throughout the series is impressive to say the least. There are some that are almost photo realistic and others that have a very unique visual aesthetic.For season 2 I'd love to seem them use the voice of Glados for one if there animations.\n",
            "Great stories. Great style. Great everything. Both entertaining and philosophic. Great job Netflix and production studios.But keep away kids, downers and feminists.\n",
            "Volume (I):- RATING - 7.5/10\n",
            "Most Favorites- E02 (Three Robots), E04 (Suits)\n",
            "Least Favorites- E06 (Yogurt), E09 (The Dump)If I were, to sum up, it is like an assemblage of distinctive storytelling, kind of an amalgamation of talented animators from all around the world. The spectrum here varies from simple 2D sketches to photo-realistic simulations; quite an ambitious endeavor, if you ask me. There are 18 episodes in total, with each of them having its own set of eccentricities and unique flavor. While I must say, some of them had struggled quite a bit to put forth their notions, others were triumphant in grabbing my curiosity.Volume (II):- RATING - 8/10\n",

However, on a collective level, the narratives are more mature, have more meaning, and most importantly the production has been top-notch. Half the time I was having difficulties distinguishing the virtual space from reality. Everything looked so life-like.Volume (III):- RATING - 9/10\n",

            "Least Favorites- E06 (Swarm), E08 (Entombed)This is by far the most balanced and superiorly well-rounded season. The primary reason is its innate incorporation of different subject matters as well as distinctive styles of animations with each one of them depicting various sets of sentiments and subtexts. A complete package!\n",
            "Each episode tells you a story that conveys a message. A must watch animation series from Netflix.\n",
            "Every once in a while, I come across a show that I can't stop talking about, and this is my new show! I wish it was longer because there wasn't one episode I didn't love! So creative and talented. Bravo to everyone who put this together. And thank you Netflix for serving us this delicious piece of art.\n",
            "Perhaps one of the most genuine and interesting projects on Netflix.An animated anthology whose strength lies in the number of stories, their variety, their animation and above all, their subject matter.About love, death, robots, or all of them together, we can witness an endless number of stories and plots for all tastes.From absurd things like Hitler's alternative futures (one of my favorites), to the satire of the 3 robots in a world without humans.But it is not only in the critics where this series stands out: it is very strong in experimental animation like \"Buena caceria\" which is raw and excellent. But it also shines when it comes to Lovecraftian creatures, or in philosophical approaches like in \"Zima Blue\".This year, Secret Level came out from Amazon Prime trying to emulate this success but not reaching these levels.In any case, this is not a perfect series and therefore has a few episodes that are either very boring or just average/bad. That's why the series' score should be given based on the sum of all its episodes.Season 1 146/18 8.1\n",
            "Season 2 57/8 7.125\n",
            "Season 3 72/9 8Total score for the series so far: 8.\n",
            "This show is amazing! The animation is great, the stories are interesting and gripping, and the episodes don't shy from humor as well.I've watched this series through 3 times by now and rewatched my favourite ones even more. My ultimate favorite is Zima Blue ! It's so cute, wholesome, and pure, but also deep, philosophical, and even insightful.There are episodes that make you think, and episodes that are just whack - but that's good either way :DStrongly recommend everyone at least try watching the show and am looking forward to the next season(s) !!\n",
            "Its not often that short film anthologies for adults are created that best reflect the short sci-fi stories that were found in the pulp pages of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" and \"Amazing Stories\". Normally you would need to read a novel or watch a full movie before the writer got to the crux of the matter. These episodes are typically less than 22 minutes and there is never a minute that is not justified in the storytelling. The stories in this series are varied in style and presentation as would be expected from the variety of creators and producers. Typically they have a high quality concept and deliver animation, script and voices of the highest calibre. Recommended for lovers of science fiction, fantasy and adventure.\n",
            "For starters; the show is an anthology, so it's probably going to be hard to review the show without spoiling, and this review may not be helpful for everyone; since a lot of people seem to like the show but generally for completely different reasons.I'll just say I was put onto this series after my university lecturer recommended it and I'm so glad that she did; it's great.\n",
            "Personally, I liked some episodes more than others, I wasn't particularly a fan of the episodes Sonnie's Edge, Lucky 13, Helping Hand, Beyond The Aquila Rift, Shape-shifters because they all looked the same (I'm a gamer but that doesn't mean I like seeing what is essentially a PS3 cutscene of extensive length, also, some of them look excellent and almost photorealistic or uniquely styled while others look only a few pixels away from being The Polar Express) and generally those episodes took themselves too seriously for what they were.And while I really loved the aesthetic and design in The Witness and I found the ending pretty nice; everything else about it could've used a lot more work.It's a mixed bag, and I can only chastise what I didn't like about certain episodes but many other people really loved Aquila Rift and Sonnie's Edge, I just found those 3D PS3 cutscene-looking episodes to be pretty bland and uninspired in design compared to the massive variety from every other episode, that being said: some of them had really good writing and performances and maybe if I watched these episodes in a different order and broke up the unending cutscene for a bit, I'd like those episodes more for the non-aesthetic differences that set them apart.\n",
            "Some people may have also seen certain reviews by film critics that disparaged the show on account of it's treatment of women, and the series itself is supposedly an unofficial continuation of Heavy Metal (1981) which had a lot of objectification in itself, so some viewers may be apprehensive about watching the series, though I will say that I don't believe those criticisms can be applieed to every episode in the series; so I'll just list the episodes that fit that description:Episodes with themes or scenes of sexual assault were Sonnie's edge, The Witness and Good hunting.Episodes where women were objectified would include the three listed above, as well as Beyond the Aquila Rift, Alternate Histories (brief scene), and very slightly in Helping Hand (features a woman in a singlet and briefs, sort of like how Ellen Ripley is seen in parts of Alien).Hopefully I didn't miss any, and hopefully you found this helpful if you wanted to watch the show but avoid those aspects.\n",
            "Fans of Robert Valley's artwork and animation style; I would encourage you to watch the show even if it's just for the episode Zima Blue, it was a pleasant surprise to see him involved in an episode.All in all though; a very nice anthology, those are hard to pull off, I'm not really a fan of any other anthologies aside from the original Twilight Zone, but I liked this one too, but for different reasons to The Twilight Zone.\n",
            "This is a great anthology series, partly because the episodes are so short and digestible, and mostly because the animation is so astounding.\n",
            "Every episode has a different art style, and some of the hyper realistic ones are almost indistinguishable from reality. I would say the show is worth the watch even if you just appreciate art and want to watch some in motion.However, just because you have a great aspect; does not mean you can skimp on the rest of what makes a show good. I think many episodes in this series truly skimped on story, with inconclusive, abrupt endings that just didn't feel right. Some episodes had no story whatsoever, which was supplemented with comedy sometimes, but other times I felt like my time was almost wasted.Considering the art style alone is enough to spend 10 minutes, even the less eventful episodes were not a total lose.The kind of show you should watch alone and just appreciate it, you will identify with different episodes than I did, and the show covers a pretty wide spectrum of themes and genres. Recommend the watch, but for the more simple watchers or story lovers, this may miss the mark.\n",
            "It is the best animeted show i watched. It has great vision. You should watch this show quickly as possible.\n",
            "I stumbled across this series 1 night when scrolling netflix and am in disbelief at how good it is. Every episode is unique in its own right and every storyline sucks you in. I love how short and to the point the episodes are so no part of the story feels drawn out or stale. Only reason it didn't get a flawless 10 was for the episodes about yogurts and the dump. Not that they were bad, but could have been alot better. Overall a fantastic watch and I am very excited for season 2 already.\n",
            "A showcase of various talents within the sci-fi writing and animation world. A superbly varied selection of short quirky stories displaying a huge range of animation and writing styles. Love , hate , hope , comedy and horror it's all here. There's something for everyone. Let's hope there'll be more seasons. Anything that celebrates new animation talent deserves our full support and admiration.\n",
            "Every episode of this show either presents a unique concept and/or artistic style. It will always surprise you with a twist in the events and leave you wanting more. I really want another season.\n",
            "An amazing collection of mostly animated short stories for grown-ups. Enjoyable assortment of fantasy, mystery, apocalypse, horror and science fiction stories in mini bites, although some viewers may feel that there is too much unwarranted nudity.Reminds me of watching cartoons when I was a kid with short enjoyable stories, but in genres that I now enjoy as an adult.At times, reminiscent of the old time tv series like Twilight Zone or Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories for some of its twisted story telling.There is a mix of animation styles used from simple old-school 2d cartoons to really amazing modern 3d animation. All done tastefully and the complex 3d ones are captivating eye candy.\n",
            "Love, death and robots is not just an animated anthology series but it has created a cult! The stories are 15-20 mins short but are really great! Loved the Chinese ghoul story the most but every story is great in its own ways! I am not gonna put any spoiler here but guys this is the most entertaining and great animated short stories series I have ever liked on Netflix!\n",
            "It blew my mind. Watching these episodes are like tripping! Amazing creation. Quick episodes like the quick bites or naps. Watch it guys. This is next level.\n",
            "The theme of each story is based around the title, Love, Death & Robots making this for an interesting watch to say the least. Reminiscent of MTV's Liquid Television or other curated animated short films from yesteryear, the admiration of the art alone can not be ignored.\n",
            "Each episode is like a brilliantly animated short film with a unique animation style, and each season packs different genres. Some episodes like Zima Blue and The Witness have stunning visuals, some have a deep, profound meaning masked under the curtain of a shallow, straightforward story, some are thought-provoking, while others are just good old action-packed thrillers.What pleases me is that despite the gruesome and often dark themes in some episodes, none are actually that heavy on your mind and don't leave you feeling awful, as some movies or shows do. The short episodes are also perfect for people with short attention spans who have trouble keeping up with everything that goes on in a 1.5hr+ movie. Very entertaining overall.\n",
            "I really liked the season 1, it's like black mirror without boundaries. How spooky future and others universes could be. The season 2 isn't such impressive like the 1, but still it is good. I'm already waiting for season 3.\n",
            "Not literally, although there's is plenty of steamy scenes.\n",
            "I've never binged watched a series all the way through in one sitting.... until this.\n",
            "Each episode individual, unique, attention grabbing and with their own surprising twists.\n",
            "Give it a try. You'll like it.\n",
            "Not for kids though, due to its graphic violence and sex scenes. Although equally matched with humour and cinematography.\n",
            "The most amazing thing i have seen on my TV. It being anthalogy is great, but every episode being different style, so well made, and interesting stories, it's just beautiful.\n",
            "I have always liked the anthology works. On the other hand, I also like animation. Again, the Sci-fi genre is my favorite one. And fantasy, horror, and comedy were at the same time as bonuses. So, this Netflix anthology series was perfectly enjoyable for me.Every single story was very interesting. Though, some of them very known to me. Cause I read them as a short story. Such as Joe R. Lansdale's horror story Fish Night and The Dump; Ken Liu's steampunk story Good Hunting.But in the series, the storied I liked most was - The Witness, Beyond the Aquila Rift, Good Hunting, The Dump, Shapeshifters, Fish Night, Helping Hand, Zima Blue, and Ice age.Overall I liked the series very much. I hoped the second season will come soon with lots of surprises.\n",
            "CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2 TO COME OUT!Everything about this show is amazing!\n",
            "Netflix again raised the bar and released a series with adult content and adult themes and AMAZING STORIES AND ANIMATIONS! Each of these could easily be turned into their own feature films.Is it dark, violent and sexy? Absolutely.Is it brilliant, fun and pure gold? Without a doubt. Just don't play it with the kids around.I can't wait for another collection or sequel!\n",
            "Amazing to finally see a show that has both been written and produced so professionally.\n",
            "The characters are raw and come away from the media with such life.\n",
            "I forgot I was watching animation the moment the show started.\n",
            "Worth watching.\n",
            "Speaks to the inner truths that we fear to speak in public.\n",
            "Are you kidding me?\n",
            "The whole show is a collection of masterpieces that the human tongue is unable to describe.It's sick, It's fascinating, It's mind blowing.\n",
            "The ability to make you love every goddamn character in less than an half an hour sometimes less than 10 minutes.Some would say it has copied from Simpsons or other movies but I disagree, it's not a copy. It's simply showing them how it's done.All in all. Perfection.\n",
            "Enjoyable. Raw. Fun.Netflix came out good with this one.\n",
            "Love death & robots is a bundle of incredible story telling and impeccable animation. I have never seen so much talent and effort put into any show, as each and every episode is a true masterpiece. It covers relevant topics and makes you feel all kinds of things, and is guaranteed to leave you wanting more!\n",
            "If you are fan of adult animation then this is must watch for you. I can assure that you won't regret.\n",
            "This is probably the best animated series I've ever saw. The mix of different stories was a no brainer considering the short episodes, which makes you want to watch more and more since every episode is more or less 10/10. 👍👍👍\n",
            "An exceptionally well crafted series with gorgeous animation and a uniquely immersive soundtrack, whats remarkable about these shorts is how quickly you can become so deeply and emotionally invested in the stories they are telling. Every character feels alive and real, human or otherwise, and each brilliantly executed scenario subverts the expectations set by its predecessor; I would watch entire ten hour seasons set in any one of them, though perhaps what most makes them shine is in fact how quickly they're over, and how lasting of an impression they leave all the same.\n",
            "Really loved it! I don't have a favorite episode every single one of them is unique and intriguing.\n",
            "Each episode of Love, Death & Robots tells a different story using different drawing techniques. Some parts are anime, some parts are animation, and even the technique used in some parts was so good that I couldn't distinguish between animation or real for a while. Each episode has a philosophical topic that we can think about or a message they want to give us. The fact that the subjects in the episodes are different gives the producers of the series unlimited subject rights, and the producers have used this right extremely well. The fact that the episodes are too short is also a plus for the series. The series never bores you. Because when you start the episode, it ends immediately and makes you ask yourself the question 'What did I watch?'. It makes you think about the episode. If you want to watch a short, perfect and different animation series prepared with different techniques, Love, Death & Robots is for you.\n",

            "An incredible anthology that delivered another collection of masterfully created works with the second volume.\n",
            "I have nothing to reference to that equals or betters this omnibus of rich and warm sci fi stories. Please take a seat and dip in into a taste of sometimes well disguised hard sci fi.\n",
            "Volume 2:SummaryThe second volume of this remarkable anthology of animated shorts is on Netflix, with its usual variety of themes, genres, characters and situations and its astonishing and varied visual qualityGeneral ReviewThe second volume of this anthology series comprises 8 animated short films (with durations ranging from 7 to 18 minutes) that cover, as in volume 1, a wide range of themes, situations, characters and genres: the automation of housework, races in menacing places, eerie breaks on a train journey, amazing Santa Claus, odyssey in remote places, genetically modified people and cyperpunks, space warriors, robots with inerperated behaviors, monsters, immortal human beings.In terms of genres, dystopian science fiction dominates (some refer to the universe of Philip K. Dick) but there are some wonderful fantastic stories - one of them Lovecraftian - two of which are among the best in the series (The grass Alta and The Sleeping Giant) and others with some touches of black comedy (Automated Customer Service and The Visit)In any case, the greatest merit of the anthology continues to be its extraordinary quality and visual variety, with a palette that goes from the comic line (Ice) to others of an astonishing hyper-realism (Refuge, Evolutionary Response and the aforementioned The Drowned Giant), going through other aesthetics closer to the Disney universe (automated customer service and The visit), stop motion and something from the visual world of video games.In short, a juicy and varied collection of shorts ideal as an aperitif before watching a movie and not bingeing on them.Individual Reviews1) Automated customer serviceA housewife must deal with the unusual setbacks caused by a malfunctioning robot vacuum cleaner.2) IceA group of modified teenagers challenge a common one to a race on a dangerous icy surface.3) Pop Sqad\n",
            "A police officer must fulfill a strange task to preserve the immortality conquered by humans.4) Snow in the desertSnow is a loner who lives in the desert and is targeted by several bounty hunters for one of his attributes.5) The Tall GrassWhen a train stops in a place of tall grass, one of its passengers decides to investigate some strange lights that appear in the distance.6) All Through the HouseA bizarre Christmas tale about an unexpected visit for two little brothers on Christmas Eve.7) Life HutchA space warrior makes an emergency landing on a planet and when entering a shelter he must face an anomalous situation.8) The Drowned GiantA naked giant seems stranded on a beach in a coastal town and arouses the curiosity of its inhabitants.2) Volume 2Summary:Tim Miller and David Fincher's new collection of animated shorts once again displays a wide variety of graphic styles (2D, 3D, CGI), tones and genres. Terror, horror, violence, action, science fiction, fantasy, humor and poetry come together in what is perhaps the best season of the series and, without a doubt, the most mature.Review:\n",
            "This volume is made up of nine shorts, whose durations range from 7 to 23 minutes\n",
            "Here are some comments on each.1) The 3 Robots: Exit Strategies\n",
            "It continues the minisaga of these acids three robots already seen in the previous volumes. Here they tour a post-apocalyptic world and deliver sharp commentary on how the ruling classes faced the end of the world and tried to survive. The style is 3D and realistic, with great attention to detail.2) Bad Travelling\n",
            "It is a terrifying marine tale, the most ambitious in the series, directed by David Fincher, about a shark fishing vessel invaded by a monster with whom the crew must come to an agreement, which triggers a game of alliances and betrayals. Hyper-realistic, sinister, dark and with an overwhelming display of gore, it is one of the best shorts of the three seasons.3) The Very Pulse of the Machine\n",
            "Amazing survival odyssey of an astronaut on Io, one of Jupiter's satellites. With a very comical 2D aesthetic, it offers us an absolutely lysergic science fiction experience, with hypnotic colors and a wonderful soundtrack. Poetic, metaphysical and absolutely moving, it is also one of the highlights of the series.4) Night of the Mini Dead\n",
            "Dizzying short film about zombies that begin to devastate different cities on Earth. The novelty lies in the \"distant\" point of view and the way in which it shows its settings, combining artifice with violence and humor very effectively. He spares no darts against the US and the insignificance of humans.5) Kill Team Kill\n",
            "Sweeping short about a US squad in Afghanistan who must rescue a hostage from a cave. With comic aesthetics, ultraviolent, abundant gore, heavy metal and biotronic animals on stage, mocking the codes of this type of story.6) Swarm\n",
            "A scientist visits an extraterrestrial biosystem called The Swarm to extract useful information from it for humans. The place has a kind of human hostess who serves as a guide. With a 3D aesthetic that is somewhat reminiscent of Avatar, both characters move through an environment between aquatic and weightless through one of the most fascinating settings in the series, where science fiction, love and horror come together.7) Mason´s Rats\n",
            "Humor returns in this story about a farmer who hires various increasingly sophisticated and violent devices to confront a plague of intelligent rats in his barn, with whom he engages in a pitched battle.8) In Vaulted Halls Entombed\n",
            "Once again a squad must rescue a hostage. But in this case it is a short film with an incredibly hyper-realistic aesthetic thanks to the use of CGI. The characters access an unsuspected ancestral setting of a net Lovecraftian stamp, bloody, colossal and dark.9) Jibaro\n",
            "We are facing another of the summits of the entire series. A group of expeditionaries -reminiscent of the Spanish conquerors due to their armor- faces a kind of aquatic nymph or undine. Greed and the possibility of love with one of them in a hyper-realistic short with an amazing use of CGI, but with a choppy and very original way of narrating. A poetic, tragic, sad and captivating story in lush settings and a great soundtrack.\n",
            "Amazing ! With a few exception episodes, everything was triple AAA\n",
            "LD&R doesnt try to entertain yoy. doesnt conform to to your reguler story troupe. it tells you ITS own story and you are entertained by it! A fresh prespective to series making (same blueprint with black mirror but animated), enjoyed every bit of it.\n",
            "Netflix has created a lot of shows in their time. Some are good, some are bad, and others are amazing. I've only watched one episode so far, namely 3 Robots, and I can't remember when I laughed so hard.Maybe it's just the nerd references that keep flying back and forth. Or the absolutely gorgeous animation. Or even the voice cast. It's just one of the best things I've seen in a long time.\n",
            "It is very good, everyone should see it, it is a different thing in this which is different from everything, I have never seen such a thing on TV in my life.\n",
            "You can't see time going by while watching this shows. It's a mix of comedy, storytelling and realky good animation.\n",
            "Best animation to date, love every story. Just the right amount of mature visual. Would recommend for every fan of mangas and comics.\n",
            "Yeah, the headline tells you the everything. Its so ridiculous, hilarious, epic and masterpiece. The art, the story, dubbing... They are all mindblowing. Warning: You will want to finish them all at one sitting, so, make sure that you have at least 4 hours-free-time. Enjoy that Netflix original artwork-masterpiece.\n",
            "THIS WAS THE BEST ANIMATION I SEEN IN LONG TIME IT WAS SUPER GREAT YULL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT JUST LIKE I HAVE CANT WAIT FOR SEASON 3.\n",
            "Some episodes were extraordinarily good some not so. You have pretty much everything in the whole series. The best thing about them is they are short and because of that you don't lose interest like you can in long winded movies. Can't wait to see if they do anymore.\n",
            "Loved every min almost if these episodes , me and my sons watched it togther the animation was great and so was the acting , told my son was just like the old heavy metal magazines, dug em out to show him, cant wait for season 2\n",

            "From the stories to the animation, this series is absolutely amazing. Yes, don't get me wrong, a few episodes are bit off, but of the 2 seasons only missing the mark on 1 maybe 2 episodes is fine. The stories are captivating and draw you in, albeit only lasting 10-15 minutes, the animation styles are incredible, and the entire production of each episode is so perfectly assembled, it'll be tough to not be extremely critical now of other animated sci-fi shows. Highly recommend, and might I add I really hope some of these stories get their due by receiving full seasons (but then again part of why you get sucked in is the limited story).\n",
            "While the individual episodes are quite good, I will make a guarantee to netflix that if you keep making science fiction/fantasy short films I will always watch them.\n",

            "I love this concept, although I like animation in general. All of the episodes are vastly different in terms of presentation, but theming as well. The only resemblance is in the key words of the title.\n",
            "Most episodes are good, some are passable, while others are jewels of animation. Beware that none of the episodes are suitable for children, so don't be fooled by the graphical style. Most episodes feature adult theming with faul language, violence, horror, boobies and some even have sex scenes.Here are my impressions:\n",
            "1.Sonnie's Edge - brutal, edgy and thrilling with the bestfight of the series. One of the best of the series.2. Three Robots -funny with likable characters.3. The Witness - paranoial. alternative and artistic.Deserves a shot.4. Suits - enjoyabl and actionful, but simple.5. Sucker of Souls- this one was a let down for me. Skippable.6. When the yoghurt take over - silly and light. For the fan.7. Beyond the Aquila Rift - amazing horror sc-fi with gorgeous sex scene and crazy reveal. Probably the beste episode in the series.8. Good hunting - beautiful story progression and finds a perfect balance between a dark and light tone. One of the best of the series.9. The Dump - meh10. Shape-shifters - not very speciall in terms of story but cool and action-packed.\n",
            "11. Helping Hand - short and very tenseful. Captivating.12.Fish Night - nice ambiance but disappointing story and the worst dialogue. Skip to prevent disappointment.13.Lucky 13 - Easily on par with Helping Hand and Shape-Shifters. Features a lot of sci-fi action and a believable and likable main character.14. Zima Blue - stylistic with a great message to tell. Don't be deceived by the first two minutes.15. Blind Spot - Ok, I guess, but nothing special or anything else to give than fighting and riacing robots.16. Ice Age- Pretty neat and enjoyable in the moment.17. Alternate Histories -not my cup of tea, but enjoyable for a lucky few.18.The Secret War - Great action and shooting. Excellent in what it wants to do.\n",
            "Not all episodes are good but 90% are very creative and thought provoking pieces of art.\n",
            "I really really like this idea. Short, well written and well executed animated shorts.All the episodes have something to offer in my opinion. Maybe it's the sign of the times. Maybe my own attention span is shorter these days.I think movies are too long nowadays anyway. Even horror films are 2+ hours. Bring back the 90 minute movies. It's a sigh of good writing and directing to make short films that captivate you.The Jibaro episode, season 3 episode 9, is one of my favorites. Very creepy and also fantastical. Everything with this episode is great. The animation, directing, story and especially the ambience of sound.\n",
            "I did not expect nothing. But this is a great anime anthology. I wished they would make films out of the clips.\n",
            "This show came out of nowhere with some outstanding animation all around and good writing that hooks the audience into it's 5-20 minute short stories, giving them just enough information to understand what's going on and become immersed in it's diverse world's without ever being didactic.L\n",
            "D&R doesn't have a consistent type of animation. Some are photo realistic, and others have a style more akin to what we'd see in morning cartoons. The creators always use the correct animation style for the type of story being told. Some of these would had probably looked creepy or lost a degree of emotion had they looked either too realistic or too unrealistic.The shows biggest strength is it's outstanding variety. There's no overarcing theme or connection between any of the episodes, but they demonstrate a knack for quickly sparking interest. Some are funny. Some are serious. Some are a mix of both. Settings are unique and interesting and episodes often have a good twist at the end. Highlights for me would be: Beyond the Aquila Rift, The Secret War, Good Hunting, and Zima Blue. There are still a few dumb or forgettable episodes such as: When the Yogurt Took Over. Watch this series and I'm sure you'll find some that you like too!\n",
            "Once I started I couldn't stop, God thing they were all shorts. The visuals on a few of these were amazing. Beyond the Aquila Rift, Lucky 13, and Sonnie's Edge were particularly well done, but they were all good. I certainly hope there's another season.\n",
            "Absolutely fantastic! A must-see for all Sci-fi fans, with short stories ranging between 7-17 minutes in length. A great spiritual successor to a cult series; thank you Tim Miller for resurrecting the this spirit!\n",
            "Lets be honest guys this series i v seen better love death and robots my favorite series after 100 i realy love it and i ll watch again one day.\n",
            "There are definitely weaker episodes, some just not utilising animation, nor story, in an artistic and interesting way, especially paling, when compared directly to the other gems in this series.Some of these films are just phenomenal, on a story level, having good characters, and character dinamics, while telling and interesting story, though the type varies drastically from episode to episode, other films shining mainly, yet not exclusively, in their way of showing us what animation and an artist vision can achieve; the episode \"Jibaro\" being for me a prime example of a beautiful story, nearly mythological, while having visuals which just keep one hypnotized.This series gives the creators a chance to fully utilise the format of short stories, as they are best approached differently from longer films, focussing on an intriguing narrative, in which one must not necessarily endulge, and letting the visual medium shine to its brightest potential.I highly recommend this series to everyone, yet especially those of you that like different and not so tipical stories, as well as visual style, as style can definitely be substance.\n",

            "I loved S1! It was the only title that never removed from \"my list\" even though I watch it almost 2 years ago.Now I am in the middle of S2, taking time between episodes, just because I want to last longer :)\n",
            "The stories, the different types of animation technics, the whole approach to this creation is mind blowing!As a kid I loved books with strange, short stories and series like the Twilight Zone.In addition to my love to comics, LD&R is an exhibition of all these combined.Not all stories are great but each one of the viewers will find different stories to love. This variety is what makes it even more interesting! I don't know what to expect in every episode and there is something there for every taste.Of course I would love to see few, if not all stories, longer but this is not the point.The photorealistic animation is great and I absolutely loved stories like the Secret War, The Witness and the Snow in Desert.I didn't like few of the stories but I enjoyed them all. Even with the stories I didn't like much a second view uncovers new details and things that stand out.For all the animation lovers, comic enthusiasts, mystery and Sci-Fi fans, LD&R is a must!The 9/10 is a great rate for me. My 10 goes to a very small club of movies and series I've watched.\n",

Definitely not a family watch because some of these shorts had a surprising amount of nudity, rape, torture, rape torture, prostitution, rape torture prostitution and overall surprisingly morbid events. It was like dexter had a cameo in the script writing. The episodes that didn't include the aforementioned were amazing tho and would highly recommend those.\n",
            "Episode 1 is good, at least I was enjoying that. But then episode 2, 3, 4 feels way too American with Tipical American \"jokes\" and plots, this show certainly will be loved just like Marvel movies are so popular. But not something for me.

Some looked great, others not so much, but it was nice to get the different looks.The writing quality also varied, from decent to teen fanfic.

That short story was magnificent and moving. Really fascinating. The sexual violence and amateaur comedy was a pass, but the short knocks it out. Silver medal to \"the Giant.\"\n",
            "Though I loved this anthology and some of the episodes are truly fantastic, I am disappointed to see almost no female directors and only one female writer in 3 seasons.In the first season (the longest) there are no women at all behind the scenes- only on camera. (Not always with their clothes off, to be fair.)It left a bad taste in my mouth.Im so happy to see animators working. Its such a difficult industry to produce in and yet, this series did not even try to let any female animators (and they are legion) tell their stories. Im positive there are women out there who have sexy, freaky, horrifying stories to tell.Do better.\n",

            "I didn't expect much from love death and robots but the series still got me a dissapointing thought when I watch a series I expect that every element has a porpurse I expect that it has themes that explores and I try to reflect that when I watch movies or series but when a series doesn't have that it's ok I will have more low standards but you still have to develop write the characters create the scenes that complement the story you need world building etc etc this elements can be explore in more depth then others but this series feels like a 15 year old teenager that thinks a concept will be enough to cover all the elements that a movie/series has to have the animation it's impressive but it gets stale really quickly when it doesn't have porpurse more than look pretty the things that death love and robots try to explore are extremely juvenile and the execution it's worse there's no time to attach to nothing there's no time to explore the concepts and there's no time to even in a superficial level say a message and to compare it to a more recent series (at least for 3 seasons) its black mirror, black mirror has a concept and develop it's it has coherent story telling it has a point and even if some episodes comes as a mess or pretencious the concept is develop enough to be consider watchable , maybe you can say that I'm judging too hard and it's time limitations doesn't have the possibility to explore this concepts but in reality this concept were made to have this duration in mind the time doesn't excuse the porpurse of art and this series wastes all the things it has in advantage and destroys it in conclusion this series is a trainwreck but if I have to give credits the writing is on point (even if is awfully estructure and it has no porpuse) the animation is really well made in some shorts and it can be charming at times but this things are limited compare to the ocean of garbage this mini series gave me\n",
            "I loved every episode of this series and to me it came from nowhere. I dont know who wrote and directed any episode, but it was outstanding and original. I'm sad tha Hollywood has no new ideas when a few of these would make great films in the same style (sonnies edge, three robots, suits, beyond the Aquila rift and shape shifters) would all make amazing films as long as they kept the same feel and ideas. I hope they do more of these and they become available to buy in hard copy forms. Again, outstanding.\n",

But while this series delivers some amazing pieces, it also delivers top tier trash.Really, you should review those Episodes one by one. There are some really nice Stories, zima blue being my favorite. But there are quite a few episodes that feel Like graphic Demos, Studios promoting how good they can make stuff Look, but lacking anything else. They feel shallow and dont bring anything new to the table. To give a reference of how much my rating would vary between episodes: 9-10 for the best and probably 2 for the worst.I would say i liked about 40% of the episodes in season one, that may be a low score, but at least those were really refreshing. So in total, i enjoyed season one, i wasnt blown away because some stories drag the overall experience a bit down. I was excited to see a Second season.Season two underdelivers. Not only are there only half as many episodes, they are also shorter and worse in overall quality. Only one Story did I actually Like, two others were okay-ish, the rest was bad.Update/edit season 3: same principles as before apply, many episodes feel like graphic demos. I don't even want to count the number of episodes that basically follow the plot \"soldier squad on their own, killing some monsters\" just in different settings. But overall I liked season 3 more than the second. It was almost worth watching. Perhaps a sign that season 4 might be good again? I certainly hope!Rating for season 1: 7-8\n",

            "I've been a longtime fan of Black Mirror. It had always felt like a modern Twilight Zone with a focus on the potential downsides of future technologies. With season 6 it feels like they threw the premise out the window and went with an anything goes approach to storytelling, including the supernatural. In addition, the overall quality of the writing has declined in seasons 5 and 6. The first 4 seasons of the show is among my favorite TV shows ever, but they seem to have mostly lost their touch.It's not that the most recent seasons are irredeemable because there are some pretty good episodes, but they are nowhere near the high bar that was set by the early seasons. Don't believe me? Go watch from the beginning and it will become obvious how much the show has changed. None of the newer episodes are remotely close to the quality of \"The Entire History of You\", \"White Bear\", and \"White Christmas.\" Even the weaker episodes of seasons 1-4 are significantly better than most of seasons 5 and 6.I suppose it's nice to get some new episodes of Black Mirror even if it isn't what it used to be, but I was hoping for much better. Despite my misgivings about the last two seasons, I hope there ends up being a season 7 because I am a big fan of the anthology series format. Overall, I still think the show deserves a solid 8 when considering the entirety of the series to this point.\n",
            "This is purely for seasons 1-4 and for Bandersnatch from season 5.Season 5 was boring and silly. Season 6 is a mixture of terrible episodes and some quite well done episodes that have nothing whatsoever to do with Black Mirror.Seasons 1 through 4 are masterpieces. Some episodes are better than others, like with any Anthology series. But the good ones are just next-level, even when you have to suspend disbelief sometimes (full nervous system VR systems the size of an M&M - no, not unless everything else is up to the same level of tech!).It seems that once a series peaks, we just have to accept that that's it, it's done, it will never get up there again. For me the high water marks were CROCODILE, METALHEAD and WHITE BEAR. Though I have to say, I still got back and watch the speech from 15 MILLION MERITS for the thrill of it. It's too good.4 seasons, 1 special - that's pretty good. Now we need something of equal calibre!\"Somebody\" removes negative reviews so I hope this one will just sail through.\n",
            "...season five was bad (episode 1), mildly acceptable (episode 2) and are you kidding me? (episode 3). Miley Cyrus? This series started out as an inventive, original and disturbing show.

            "Well, season 1-4 is a solid 9 for me. Really, really good TV.This newest installment however is not. I guess it's all right for a quick watch - but it is not classic Black Mirror worthy material.The mind bending and often dark moments are completely gone.3 out of 5 episodes would've fit better under Del Toro's Cabinet of Curiousities, which were funnily enough also very lacking (not very Del Toro ish, eh?)I think the culprit here is Netflix.Almost anything produced by NF these recent years has been creatively lacking and dragged out to keep view score up. Looking at Stranger Things, The Witcher and Cabinet of Curiousities. Only Better Call Saul managed to stay consistent till the end, in my opinion.It's a shame really.Kudos to Aaron Paul for a solid performance in this seasons best episode. Unfortunately it suffered under lazy writing, became a drag and ultimately failed as a BM episode.I'm just glad Brooker made season 1-4 which I'll happily rewatch now and then. Thank you.\n",
            "What on earth I've just watched! This is definitely not Black Mirror. We can give a slight chance to episode 3, other than that nope! I mean the stories are below average and the directors ruined the whole series and shattered the reputation of the holy til now Black Mirror.It seems I should write more, ok I can elaborate; Where is the original Spirit? You can call it horror series for children, maybe! Again, if you take out the third episode, the whole season will be unwatchable. Netflix thought they will ditch the crisis if they allow self-critic. I hate the company more now after this s*** show, literally, s*** show!\n",

            "I'm a big fan of Stephen King books and when done right, the movies.Black Mirror took a spin out of Stephen King's creative layers when it first came out.Taking popular ideas, concepts, tech and showing us the pro's and the cons more or less. It's what made it, \"Black Mirror\"The last couple of seasons have lost all Black Mirror'esq feeling. Leaving me bored, watching a predictable tale, or something that's already been covered before.The first few Seasons were phenomenal. Sure, there were episodes where I wasn't as thrilled, but overall, each season felt unique. Until 5 & 6.5 & 6 were bland, boring, and by the title of Black Mirror are they only able to acquire such reviews for the new season. People get stuck in a trending review cycle. Oh it's amazing because it's \"Black Mirror\".Nope, not at all, honestly, watch the first 4 seasons, love them, then move on. COVID has yet killed another awesome show. Like most films after COVID, we suddenly have been left in a predictable world without much controversy. Dare we be controversial in fear that we get cancelled.That's my take. Find out for yourself, but certainly don't leave a 10/10 as if there isn't one thing that could be better. I've never seen a 10/10... Foundation... Quite potentially the closest to a 10/10 I've seen.Now there's a show people should go watch... Watch Foundation. And until Black Mirror gets it's head out of it's... I don't think it's worth it anymore.\n",
            "Black Mirror has always been a gripping anthology series that explored the dark side of technology and its impact on society. With its clever storytelling and thought-provoking themes, it became a staple for fans craving dystopian tales that held a mirror up to our own world. However, Season 6 left me perplexed and disappointed, as it seemed to deviate from the very essence of what made Black Mirror so special.The episodes in this latest season seemed to lose their focus on the technological aspect that defined the series. Instead, they veered into more supernatural and abstract territories that left me scratching my head. While experimentation can be commendable, it should still stay true to the core identity of the show. I struggled to understand how some of these episodes related to the central theme of technology's impact on society. The lack of a clear connection was jarring and left me feeling disconnected from the narrative.Moreover, the episodes lacked the biting social commentary that was once a hallmark of Black Mirror. Previous seasons masterfully critiqued our reliance on technology, our obsession with social media, and the potential dangers of unchecked scientific advancements. In contrast, Season 6 seemed more interested in exploring philosophical musings and metaphysical concepts. While these ideas can be intriguing in their own right, they didn't feel like they belonged in the Black Mirror universe.As a longtime fan, I found myself yearning for the clever twists and shocking revelations that made the earlier seasons so memorable. The writing, while still competent, failed to deliver the same impact and left me longing for the intellectual depth that was once a trademark of the show. The stories lacked the punch and resonance that kept me on the edge of my seat in previous seasons.While I appreciate the creators' willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas, I can't help but feel that Season 6 strayed too far from the original Black Mirror formula. It feels like a missed opportunity to further explore the chilling consequences of technology in our lives. As a result, I'm reluctantly lowering my initial rating for this season. I hope that future seasons can recapture the essence of what made Black Mirror so captivating in the first place.Overall, Season 6 of Black Mirror left me perplexed and unsatisfied. It deviated from the show's main concept and failed to provide the gripping narratives and societal critique that fans have come to expect. Here's hoping that the next season will be a return to form for this once groundbreaking series.\n",
            "So while Seasons 1 to 5 have been punchy, and captivating from the first to last second, Season 6 is suffering from Netflix Disease i.e. Pad it out with narrative filler to get it out to 40 min (the longer you keep us watching, the less we are watching your streaming competitors).So all but Ep2 has dragged from the start, and could have got to the not too bad endings within 20min.Get the original UK writers in again and try a reboot. Short, sharp and punchy once more. Perhaps we'll get a few more episodes per season too.Please, please save this awesome show by giving it back to the Brits!\n",
            "Black Mirror started out great and has had a good run with the first four seasons. Season five had no quality, despite only consisting of 3 episodes. Rest in peace.\n",
            "Black Mirror was once known for projecting a grim future, 10 minutes away from where we are. We didn't watch it to be amused nor excited, we watched it with the intent of being bummed out. We expected to welcome the credits with an awesome feeling of self loathe. This was the point. Black Mirror is the reflection of yourself in your phone screen when the screen is turned off. A dark reflection of who you are. The intention is to show a dark depiction of ourselves through technology. Exactly what a Black Mirror is.Throughout its time on Channel4 it was allowed to explore this, thus generating a huge following of people like myself who demand depth, intrigue and not your typical fairytale stories made to meet a wide audience to generate ££. It was so ridiculously thought provoking I would go as far as to say it was one of the greatest TV programmes to come out of the UK! Which leads me to the problem.. it came out of the UK.I was slightly nervous when I discovered it was moving to Netflix. Anxious as I knew the Americans were going to have a huge hand in the subject matter and storylines, yet marginally comfortable in knowing Netflix (like Channel4) has a reputation for taking risks on out of the box stories. The reason I was anxious about the Americans is not some deep shred of racism. It is simply that there is a huge difference between how British and American audiences receive TV programmes. This is common fact when it comes to comedy, but it is also apparent in emotion inducing drama too. If you study popular American TV versus popular UK TV you can easily see that British audiences are more comfortable with 'out of the ordinary', uncomfortable and especially dark subject matter. We don't mind hating ourselves, in fact we quite like it and are pretty good at it!Series 3 turned out to be pretty damn good actually. San Junipero in particular is my favourite episode of the whole programme! The programme was allowed to retain that awful feeling of dread, the familiarity, the dark techno-aware subjects that depicted who we could be, who we would be and who we are now! There did seem to be a little more of a Hollywood type of feel to the whole thing, yet that didn't matter too much as long as the stories could run their course!However. Since then there has been a huge decline in what we come to expect of the show we know and love. USS Callister was, for me a small shining light (or rather a welcome opposite to that entirely), but still didn't give me that sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach. The episodes began to get milder and milder, taming down to suit a wider audience who would be at greater risk of running away If you were to show them an early episode. Yes there was tragedy, yes some of the storylines were dark. But its where the darkness comes from that matters! We didn't want obviously fictional narratives, we wanted ones that seemed real! That could be here and now and not too far away. We didn't want the big dramatic moments, the killer shots or the epic finale, we want mellow darkness and discomfort.Finally we reach series 5. A series that has completely and utterly disappointed me on all levels. Well, not all. They are entertaining, but definitely not in Black Mirror fashion. Where are the twists, the thought provoking, self hating moments. The situations which present to you a perfectly twisted, yet astonishingly accurate version of the world we live in?If you were to grab someone who was disinterested in Black Mirror's subject matter, and ignorant of its relevance and show them just a couple of episodes from the first series, but let them just mildly watch it without truly getting it.. then ask them to describe it to you: what you would have is Series 5.... A few entertaining yet dark stories with a bit of technology thrown in. Yes we know that the app they use in episode two is metaphorical of our current social media platforms and how we are all addicted. You are not incredibly smart for figuring that out because it's so blindingly obvious and in your face. Black Mirror has been showing us that same metaphor in so many episodes, but it's been so good because it has been a genuinely clever metaphor and has been presented perfectly!I genuinely feel as though the smartness of the programme has been lost. That it has now become a parody of itself and is simply a few slightly tragic (but not too tragic) stories with some technology in them. It doesn't take a great deal of intellect or understanding to grasp the concepts. Themes are also being rehashed into more diluted versions that are easier to palette for everyone! This might sound extremely harsh and make me sound like an awful person, but I see from my social media, so many more people talking about how amazing it now is. These people are the type that find films such as White Chicks funny and who's favourite film is Titanic. They talk about how clever the programme is after watching the latest series and that it's got so much more better as they didn't understand the first few series. I find myself internally screaming at them \"NO YOU DON'T DESERVE TO APPRECIATE THIS PROGRAMME\" the message is lost on so many!I still have faith, which is why I've given a 9. The first 3 series get 10 from me, the 5th gets a 2.\n",
            "I don't know what happened, but the sci-fi element, the existential subtext, THE reason black mirror was so profound, is lacking in season 6. Who thought it was ok to do pedestrian stories? None of these, even the meta meta attempt to warn against AI, hit the mark. The show used to push the eerily gray conversation of what it meant to BE in a world of technology, but season 6 is just Shyamalan doing his rendition of twilight zone.I'm a long time fan of Black Mirror. The gems in the earlier seasons were complex, nuanced and full of ideas that pushed and tugged on world views and the concept of self. The terror and fascination held me in awe of what could be. It was a way to show the possibilities and consequences of our humanity, told in an exquisitely personal way. I still get chills watching The Entire History of You, White Christmas, White Bear, Playtest, and San Junipero. The Netflix seasons have taken a noticeably curt interpretation of what the series represents. And I know they don't like to do more than 3 seasons of stuff, but if you are don't skimp. Don't hamper the goodwill and impact because you don't want to invest in qualitative oversight.Down from a 10 to an 8.\n",
            "After building a great reputation of being such a creative, scary, funny series it seems Charlie Brooker either has finally lost his imaginative flare or has lost creative control. I was so looking forward to seeing what season 6 would bring, given the events that have unfolded over the past 4 years. Sadly however, season 6 was bitterly disappointing. The story lines seemed rushed, lacking his creepy, exciting spark. It really did feel like someone else had written the episodes entirely and that Brooker had lost creative control. I can't say I truly enjoyed a single episode, but rather finished each episode thinking... where that was meh.What happened Charlie? Why did you beer of track? Black mirror is no longer.\n",
            "Season 6 is nothing like the rest of the other seasons, except episode 1 and 2. The rest were sucky, long cliches. Not sure what happened. There was nothing interesting about the werewolf. The beginning was so boring, I kept thinking where's the twist. Also there's always some kind of technology story going on. Nothing. Nothing original in the werewolf episode. Then the last episode was worse than any episode of Twilight Zone. Cliche. Someone finds a medallion, the world is endings , they must kill people so demon gets wings. So unoriginal it's unbelievable it's a part of Black Mirror. I would recommend all the seasons and episodes, but only the first 2 episodes in season 6. Just be prepared to know that this season is different from other seau in free as.\n",
            "This show was absolutely amazing until season 5 which has evolved into a boring, Americanised pile of garbage.\n",
            "I think we'll all agree that this is not Black Mirror. At least it's not what it used to be.There's nothing wrong with change from season to season, to a certain extent but what they did here was made a completely different series using the name of Black mirror.If you are expecting to get your mind blown by the darkest side of crazy technological advances and its effects on people's lives, etc, you are going to be extremely disappointed. There's a little bit of that in the first couple of episodes (still very very light compared to previous seasons) but most episodes are more like short horror movies, and they remind me A LOT of Inside No. 9 which I'm sure they've taken some inspiration from. Where 99% of the action and twists happen in the last 1% of the episode.Conclusion: It is well done and definitely worth watching if you like horror and dark humor but it is just way too different to deserve to be called Black Mirror anymore.\n",

            "What the hell happened to this show?? Seasons 1-3 were brilliant. And it went downhill from there. We finally get a Season 6 and it's just horrible. Like why are the episodes so gory and violent now? They're trying too hard to be a horror show now and losing the whole theme of the show - which is how technology will mess is up... hence the title 'Black Mirror' (seeing your reflection on a blank device screen).I'm starting to think that they got interfered by higher ups (like much higher up) for showcasing technology that actually exists or in the works, and stopping them from showing it to prevent people from causing backlash when those technologies come more mainstream on the population.In season 6, episode 1 was decent because it's a good point to actually read what these big tech companies are putting in their T&C's. And episode 2 was ok, because society glorifies true crime content. But the rest were just random and garbage.They shouldn't have brought the show back if they aren't going to stay true to their theme.\n",
            "Season 1-4 are amazing. I rated 10/10 for all. But season 5, there's no Black mirror elements in all 3 episodes. I was so excited and started on 5th June itself.All 3 are very average stories, The 2nd and 3rd episode is very predictable and 1st one has a small twist that too not that imapct full.\n",

            "This series decrease quality after Netflix took it, but Season 6 is worst trash that I watched in years. Terrible waste of time. Really bad stuff which shouldn't belong in Black Mirror series. Some episodes are less bad than other but overall experience is awful. Is it possible that somebody get paid to make this garbage?!!! I really can't believe that somebody approved this mess. There are many english shows that Americans spoil in their versions, but this us too much.I have only one message to people who didn't watch this - just don't watch it. Don't waste your time. Don't spoil memory of once good show.\n",

            "Seasons 1-4 was a near masterpiece, Season 5 was terrible, but still felt like a Black Mirror universe. Then there's Season 6, which didn't even feel like a Black Mirror show, other than Episode 3, Beyond the Sea, which was pretty good and Episode 1 which was pretty average. But you had 4 years to make up for Season 5, but you release a bunch of random episodes that feel out of place. I mean it would've been decent episodes for Twilight Zone or something, but it just wasn't Black Mirror. I would drop the ratings to a 5/10, but out of respect for the first 4 seasons, I couldn't go lower than an 8/10 because it would've been a 9-10/10 if the series ended at season 4.\n",

            "It's strange that in the modern era - one of still rapid technological change, global influence and experimental social reform, one would find it difficult to come up with futuristic, technology and culture focused dystopias - the kind which was the original focus of this psychological thriller anthology. Certainly people themselves fear these potential endpoints probably more than ever.The show has always had some unevenness. This has been true since the first season, of course (the mixed nature of the episodes). But the premise - a dark reflection of reality, hence the name is now all but absent from the show. And absent this unique spin on the twilight zone-esque genre, the thought provoking, or challenging commentary what's left is more of a competently produced, fantasy/science fiction thriller anthology.Good, but not great.\n",
            "A very disappointing season. The success of the series is based on intelligent thought provoking episodes that usually have a twist at the end. With the new sudden technological advances such as AGI and AR I thought there would be new interesting episodes based on that. The only episode that fit this criteria was beyond the sea.The Mazey day episode I watched second and nearly gave up watching the rest. A 12 year old could have written that twist at the end and has been done to death. Completely unoriginal and childish, what's the point. Another episode had a demon. Why!?A DEMON And A WEREWOLF!?\n",
            "Well, I have to admit, I've swallowed it, alright... But when I've got through those two seasons, I felt something odd - why do I have the feeling that this artsy, independently presented thing seems to have a hell of a budget for the special effects department, and why do 90% of the episodes ramble about TV shows or the likes ? Hm. And then I watched the credits - what a surprise !!! Pure, black mirrory irony: the producer of this show is Endemol - pretty much THE production company worldwide who entertains or should I say renders people completely stupid in front of their TV set with exactly the type of shows criticized along the Black Mirror Episodes. Wow. Now you can call me paranoid or a conspiracy addict, but that seems like a perfect marketing strategy to me: Depict those shows, which would eventually come up next, a little irony here, a bit of voyeurism there, see which one pays off in the audience and the forums and here we go for the next-gen batch of stupid game and reality shows. I must say, the best scenario definitely goes to Endemol's think tank. Bravo.\n",

            "I watched all seasons and I recommended this movie to everyone around me. Season 6 however is full of blood, violence, murders, murders, murders and again murders. It was dissappointing and it's not only my opinion.It feels like they changed the writers and those writers are horror movie writers. Sorry, but I don't recommend season 6 to anyone. It feels like I lost my time watching all season 6' episodes.If you don't have inspiration anymore, stop the movie.I recommend the seasons 1-5, there are some episodes that I will never forget, best Science fiction series I watched until now. Thank you.\n",
            "Not sure how any of these episodes checked off the boxes qualifying them to be labeled Black Mirror. They were watchable but nothing as I have come to expect from the series.The first episode, Joan is Awful was the only one that might belong in the franchise. The episode Beyond the Sea was the lone shining star for me. There was enough there that I could see it potentially as a pretty interestiing movie on its own. The remaining episodes were just C-minus fillers.I miss the previous BM seasons that made you stop in your tracks for 2 seconds and question if this could be possible? Season 6 was something but not BM.\n",
            "Black mirror the original series from BBC was a piece of art. A dark and dystopian view of how technology could benefit our lives and turn horribly wrong at the same time. This original series left you questioning our relationships with technology and what the consequences of our daily habits with it are.But ever since Netflix bought the series it just went downhill from there. The overall forced American feel and the need for fancy actors to make up for the disappointing storylines is just disappointing. The original premise of the series just vanished when the last season aired. Now the series, like a lot of Netflix content is just mediocre and made for entertainment reasons.Way to ruin one of the best series in the world Netflix.\n",
            "Great show. Honestly. It messes with your mind. But someone who knows how to get in contact with the creators or a producer - tell them they need to do an episode based off of 1984 by George Orwell.\n",
            "I am sort of expecting one more episode in season 6, where they reveal that the writers were striking and the five first episodes in S6 were written by an AI which was not even given the scripts of the first five seasons, but instead some greedy exec thought he could do without the writers and was just writing prompts. That would redempt the whole season, even though it was not entirely bad, just mostly not delivering what the previous seasons did.Seasons 1-5, on the other hand, while varying from episode to episode, as a collection reached such heights that I'll let S6 slide.My personal favourites were Hang the DJ, San Junipero, Striking Vipers and Nosedive, but many others were also good.\n",
            "Some people can't get enough of it and some seem to hate it. Reviewers who are saying S5 is not Black Mirror appear to want each episode to fit into a certain perceived format and anything outside of that is rubbish. Stifling people's creativity. Maybe it is just a little too high brow for some. I thought the basic premise was to build a story around some form of internet technology and how it effects people or society on the whole. Each episode throughout and especially in S5 does exactly that. What is the problem? Good TV can sometimes make you squirm in your seat or make you feel awkward. It challenges your way of thinking. Brilliant! I definitely want more.\n",
            "If you want to eat popcorn in your couch and watch something predictable where the bad guys are killed mercilessly by some agency one more time, wait for the decaf American remake, it could be even starred by Tom Cruise, of course, to add depth to the storyline, you know.But if you're after something fresh, thought-provoking and that for sure can happen in the not-so-distant future, if not already happening now, give a try to Black Mirror.A very interesting point is, they're not \"distant-future\" sci-fi stories, but relate to common people on the everyday use of our beloved gadgetry, the lack of regulation, the lack of privacy ... some of the stories are already happening today: Bullying, Video-recording in everyone's pocket, streaming of private life ... If you like technology you'll love Black Mirror.\n",

            "Some advice.... go and re-assess Black Mirror past seasons before saying it is rubbish now.I have never believed that Black Mirror is a perfect show. I have never believed that everything Charlie Brooker is either funny or spot on.What I DO believe is that Charlie Brooker always has interesting ideas that intrigue or interest me and cause me to think on something in a way I haven't necessarily considered.The episodes he puts out are never perfect for every viewer and his theme is not always clear or his point not made hugely well. Some episodes are just fun and some I think are more for Charlie himself because \"screw everyone else's view, I just like it\".So again I say reflect on past episodes, I think EVERY episode satisfies the \"i wonder what this one is about\" requirement of Black Mirror and if the execution of every episode is not successful I DON'T CARE. Genuinely, I enjoy every episode for every idea and enjoy the \"would I have explored that theme that way\" post viewing debate and discussion.But that's just me.\n",

            "One of the most captivating shows of all time has been undone by an ill attempted season. It would be grave injustice to not write this review and let people suffer through the terrible monstrosity. Do not watch it but with low expectations.Apart from 1 or maybe 2 episodes the whole season is without substance, story, script and any concieveable message or \"moral of the stories\". I don't know what happened and why it happened but the writers deviated from their old ways quite a bit.The one good positive is tha acting. They sure employed brilliant actors who did their job wonderfully, even in the awful episdoes.\n",
            "Remember that sick twisted feeling you get after watching one of these episodes? Weird right? So skip season 5. Cool ideas, ok tv but horribly written and put together. I don't call season 5 black mirror. It's dumb and just not as gripping as most other seasons. Like remember shut up and dance? Or hang the DJ? Season 5 is not even close to those episodes. Watch it if you please but lower your expectations.\n",
            "Seasons 1-4 were brilliant. All unique themes woven into creative stories that unraveled at just the right pace.Season 5, not so much. It had nothing to do with the noticeably more mainstream actors; they didn't have much to work with. The writers seemed to rehash technology themes, but didn't work up the sickening sense of dread that we've come to expect of Black Mirror.Without it, the season feels forced and preachy. Ultimately, I was bored with Season 5. Good thing each episode is standalone, otherwise the entire series would be ruined.ETA June 2023: After finishing the first episode of Season 6, I was super excited because I thought it was Black Mirror returned to form. Unfortunately, the rest of the season is lackluster; the actors turn in great performances, but the storylines were weak and, as another reviewer described it, bloated. It's not as a bad as S5, so my rating doesn't change. Still totally worthwhile.\n",
            "Black mirror has a unique vibe in its episodes. I really, really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. Season 4 had some great episodes, also some less entertaining episodes. But season 5 doesn't feel like black mirror at all. It seems like the technological dystopia that every great episode had, was not recognized in season 5. It felt more like 3 short mainstream films to me. Season 5 just wasn't dark enough and it was too expectable. The acting is good don't get me wrong, but the stories in the fifth season aren't like they were in seasons past. Seasons 1-4 a solid 9, season five a 6, but in terms of relevance to black mirror, I wouldn't even rate it.\n",

That's what it is.Never wrote a review before. But this is far too overrated. Please use your time for one of the many good productionsI am sure you can find a lot of movies of people \"meeting\" animals.. if you are into this stuff.

Season 6 is as plain as any other random movie that will bore the brains out if me. Nothing spectacular, very predictable and I will forget 90% of it in a few days. This is not the quality stories that Black mirror used to tell. I watch the series at home, with my husband. It's usually at night and don't appreciate the times I had to switch the contrast of my tv or turn the volume down because suddenly a scene where a giant flashlight is burning my eyeballs. Or when the characters murmur almost the entire episode and they suddenly decide to blast annoying music. This is ridiculous, doesn't anyone even check if these things are comfortable to watch!?I think this might be an effect that was looked for, to annoy and create an atmosphere, instead of actually writing an interesting plot and I highly dislike it. Yet, we already have Open AI guys, come on... I don't think it's that impossible to continue the series in an original and innovative manner. I don't care if another season is coming up and I won't watch it.. This is another thing that just got down hard.\n",

            "There are good TV shows, great TV shows and then there is Black Mirror. I knew nothing about the show before getting into it and I am not a fan of horror, so I was skipping this every time it appeared on my Netflix watch-list, especially as it was giving the creepy vibes. But, how wrong was I!! This even remotely does not belong to the horror-genre.. I clicked play on Netflix and the first episode I ever watched was USS Calister (Netflix decided to automatically play the most recent season first even though I did not watch previous episodes!!), but a glad mistake, I was spellbound by the end of the it. It was everything for the \"nerd\" in me times 100!! There was cool tech, the mother, gripping story-line and homage to Star Trek, I was soo pleased by the end of it that I wanted to watch it again! Then I read about the series and found of that the show was an anthology, mainly created by ITV and purchased by Netflix after they noted its brilliance. My binge-watching marathon commenced, right from the first episode of season one (you can watch it in any order, but if you want to see the evolution of a relatively low budget series into a Netflix extravaganza, I would recommend watching in the order which the show intended to) The first episode with the UK Prime Minister and the pig was bizarre to say the least, still with brilliant writing but the second and third episodes were one of the best things I ever watched. Season 2 started with an amazing, heart-touching episode and then ends with a bang in the form of \"White Christmas\". This episode was screen-writing at its best and provides a very convincing/shocking premonition of what future tech will evolve into!Season 3 and this is where you can see how Netflix millions manifest onto small screens. Brilliant episodes, one after the other and it is soo satisfying to binge-watch them! Season 4 continues the same theme of excellent episodes and ends with a bang in the form of \"Metal Head\" and \"Black Museum\"!! I wish Netflix announces season 5 soon as I simply cannot get enough of Black Mirror!! Do yourself a favour and do not miss this master-piece at any cost. It really is \"worth\" the Netflix subscription!My Fave episode in chronological order:Fifteen Million Merits: Amazing insight of the power of media plus the gorgeous-gorgeous Jessica Brown Findlay ...\n",

            "I had Black Mirror at a 10, even after the mediocre season 5. Season 6 was just such a huge disappointment that it made me come back and write this review and change my rating to a 7. I'll start off with the positives, specifically for S6. You get 10/10 for meeting the diversity requirements. I won't say more about that which hasn't already been said, and I'm aware that the show was already incredibly diverse, but this was the first season where I sincerely felt it was forced.That said, the myriad of characters in S6:E1 were awesome and hilarious. Best episode of the new season by far. Great writing specifically. Very clever, and I laughed throughout.Anyone reading this review should know that seasons 1-4 are all mostly incredible TV, and you should not miss them. Season 5... well ok. With season 6 you would be better off just watching the first episode which was the only one which had any sort of originality. After that, you get a Twilight rip-off, a predictable space soap opera, and a shadow of a serial killer documentary, not to mention, the formulaic 'strong female character' throughout.Season 6 is simply dialing it in. It's almost like watching your childhood hero getting fat and complacent. Love you Brooker, but I hope for better.\n",
            "Watched 3 episodes of season 6 and it remarkable how the mighty fall; nothing to recommend, no spoilers here, but please don't waste your time; a pale imitation of the great preceding seasons - should have quit while ahead.Having said that, previous seasons are mostly very good, so maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but have to bring this up as it is a real let down.I will not be going on to further episodes; my desperate hope of something better is not enough now that I have seen the initial episodes, which were well below par.Just look at the previous seasons, some of them are absolutely brilliant :-)\n",
            "I'll keep this review short and simple. Black Mirror is horror that we live on a daily basis. I feel like me typing out this review could be made into a Black Mirror episode that would scare the crap out of me. There are no cheap jump scares, no things that go bump in the night. This is pure psychological warfare. This is questioning your reality. The scariest part? We're always one second away from being a Black Mirror episode...or maybe we're already living in one right now. Black Mirror is one big glitch in the Matrix and I'm living for it. No matter what device you're reading this review on right now, once the screen times out, there's only you, and your reflection in that Black Mirror.\n",
            "I just finished season 6 at morning. Best episodes are \"Beyond the sea\", \"Joan is awful\". I will give 9/10points on these episodes. There are giving some thoughts. But other episodes are so messy. I didnt feel like that im watching \"Black mirror\". Its seems like AHS (American Horror Story) or some normal horror thriller series. I was waited so long and now little bit disappointed. Where is the old black mirror feeling? Just i forced myself to finish watching it (especially episode that Mazey day and Demon 79) Its so boring and messy trash episodes.For me the best seasons are 1, 2 and 3. I miss old episodes.\n",
            "Like good science fiction does, Black Mirror showed us a view of our future. A future of great technological advancement, but with diminished purpose and meaning. Right out of the gate, BM was brilliant and daring. It might have been the first television show that warned us of the dangers of modern technology.The problem is now, that the technology that BM predicted has basically come true and passed BM by. So season 6 really has nothing new to say, and what's more the stories it tells are pretty boring. I was not thrilled with season 5. I felt the showing was getting too cute, and that it had lost its edge. So 4 years later, season 6 finally arrived, and it's just not good at all. I was so curious, that I immediately watched episodes from season 1-2, and yes our memory is correct, the show used to be brilliant and innovative. Season 6 feels like the CW has tried to do a copy of Black Mirror.My only hope is that in the last 4 years, Booker has written some film scripts or has another show in the works, because BM seems like it is over.\n",

Anyway, ep 1 from season 6 was hmm ok. The rest is just awful.It was really obvious the should have continued the same style of content i dont know why they changed something so easy to observe. I hope they will change it back maybe in sez 7 if it is happening but these are just speculations.\n",
            "So sad when you see a good series lose sight of the big picture and what it began as. Each season drifts further and further away from the general idea which Black Mirror presented. Season 6 is by far the worst. Since when did Black Mirror turn into \"true blood\", vampire diaries, van helsing. This \"Twilight\" looking garbage is something that should have never hit the screens, rather a brick wall. Having in mind the existence of technologies such as chatgpt, dall-e, etc you would have had a better outcome using them instead of hiring teenagers, giving them beer (as if you can call what you have there beer), locking them in a room with a spinner and expecting magic.\n",

            "Black Mirror, Season 5, 3 hour-long episodes.Ep1, Striking Vipers (60 mins): Charlie Brooker's premise is that there's no sex like VR sex. Danny and Karl, a pair of straight black guys, experience sexual-confusion when they play a VR fight-game \"Striking Vipers X\", one whose avatar is a hot blond chick and the other a hot asian dude. After their first awkward VR kiss, there's very little fighting and a whole lot of R-rated soft porn - yes, you have to suspend a WHOLE LOT of your critical thinking to let this play out. Danny is married and boinking wife Theo for a kid but his torrid albeit confusing affair with Karl's avatar in \"Striking Vipers X\" is adversely affecting those efforts. She suspects something but he's committed to the lie till he can't, then just forget the ending because that is NOT how things would play out, but Black Mirror is more about stretching the possible than adhering to the likely. Episode is about twice as long than it needs to be. Rating: 7 of 10Ep 2, Smithereens (70 mins): Charlie Brooker's cautionary tale of social media's responsibility in distracted driving. This episode delivers commentary on several elements of technology: the inherent insecurity of ride sharing, how social media founders have lost control over their creations, and how easy it can be to surmount rigid password privacy rules if you're connected. Episode is about 1/3 longer than it needs to be. Rating: 8 of 10, has a touching moment or twoEp 3, Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too (67 mins): Miley Cyrus plays Ashley O, a famous pop singer victimized by an overlording adoptive aunt and her coterie. Rachel is a young femme fan of Ashley's and even more so when Ashley releases a tiny android version of herself called \"Ashley Too\" to help young girls build self-esteem and confidence. Once the full potential of the little droid is realized though, it unleashes the full, profanity-laden personality of Ashley O. There's another tech element to this but it's not worth describing since the whole episode is marred by three things: first, its target demo is tween girls and guess who doesn't watch \"Black Mirror\" at all? Yeh, tween girls. Second, Miley Cyrus as pop star plays more to her fantasy than ours, and her voicing the \"Ashley Too\" bot is so raw and without any voice-over talent, it just sounds like her talking/swearing in normal voice. And third, throughout the episode she sings a butchered pop version of \"Head Like a Hole\" (Nine Inch Nails, 1989) and it just grates your soul. Masculine Guy Rating: 3 of 10, Tween Girl Rating: 8 of 10Overall rating for the season: 6 of 10, meh, blah\n",
            "Where is it heading, i think the creators have run short of ideas or how to implement them. It used to rely n tech concepts, questioning morality, shocking incidents all close to reality. The latest season is just another netflix usual like the \"usual\" serial killer, random demons etc etc \"future\" or \"past\" part all take a back seat to some mediocre story telling. Last 5 years i have been going out of my way to recommend this series to people, but now I hope they do not start from this season!For me the biggest cons :\n",

            "I really wanted to like these new black mirror episodes but they were simply not it. The only good thing about this season was Aaron Paul who is simply a baller in everything he is in. Other than that, these episodes are a waste of time and no where near the true original black mirror episodes. It's like they locked the original writers in a room and made them watch a bunch of leftist nonsense until there writing abilities sucked and changed completely. Man I loved black mirror and this ruined it for me. Fire these writers and get the originals back. Not sure why you would fire them or get replacements. Please make season 7 solid. That's all I ask.\n",
            "Now don't get me wrong black mirror is amazing. It shows possibilities of inventions and anti-utopias in the future and some are happening today. But Season 5 feels to Americanised and just crappy. The only decent episode in season 5 is smithereens. But then you have the other two. The Ashley O one is just crap. And striking vipers is OK. The whole idea of black mirror is the abuse of technology and how it effects people. But I feel like after season 4 it's just gone down. For my advice watch all the way through season 1-4 because mostly all of them are good with some off them which are OK but still are good concepts. And in season 5 just watch smithereens and maybe striking vipers don't watch the Ashley O episode. Otherwise except from them episodes the series is really good and I would recommend it.\n",

Annoying some episodes, and disturbing only for the needles purposeless violence. I was a bit on the edge to turn on the season, as i can't say most of Season 1-5 was particularly easy to digest, and i really felt like i want to be mentally prepared to take it in.

The individual episodes are not supposed to coordinate with each other . There is NOT supposed to be continuity .

While there was one standout episode titled \"Joan is Awful\" that showcased brilliant performances by Selma and Annie, the remaining episodes fell short of expectations. I found them to be boring, slow-paced, and with underwhelming plots.The season had its moments of brilliance, particularly with the exceptional performances by Selma and Annie in \"Joan is Awful.\" However, the overall lackluster episodes prevented the season from reaching its full potential.Taking my overall viewing experience into account, I would give the entire sixth season of Black Mirror a rating of 5 out of 10. While it had its highlights, the season as a whole failed to deliver the same level of captivating storytelling that fans have come to expect.It's important to remember that personal opinions may differ, and while I may have found some episodes lacking, others might have resonated with different viewers. Although I was disappointed with this particular season, I remain hopeful that future installments of Black Mirror will recapture the brilliance that made the series so popular.\n",

            "If you like to watch 50 mins long movie ideas that are scrapped and denied by higher ups, enjoy.It's not that the quality is low. No it isn't. It's just not high on visuals or story or the dialogs.\n",
            "I loved this show but and theres always a but. I was not keen on the new season 6 and very disappointed. It was more horror, drama and less Sci-fi. Black mirror is all about the sci-fi. This new season just didn't work for me. The stories were nothing new and done a hundred times before. Its such a huge shame as this was a good show. The last seasons gives us a glimpse into the very near future on what could happen with tech, A. I and social media network. If they ever do another season, hopefully they return to the sci-fi which blew our minds back in the day. We can only hope and see what the future holds for black mirror. Let's hope they go back to the sci-fi we all love.\n",
            "Why are you wasting time reading reviews? Just go watch it. It's brilliant. You may want to skip the first episode as it is very inferior to every other one. On the other hand, they just keep getting better, so you may as well watch it, and keep getting surprised. I just don't want you to see the first one, and think it's not any good. Here is what you need to know. This show will make you think. It has some futuristic science fiction very well done (I am a futures studies author, so trust me on this). The name black mirror means that it shows you some very dark aspects about our society. Problem is that they are not so far fetched and you will relate to some of them. Every episode is unrelated, so that thing I talked earlier about the first one not being very good, is not a problem.\n",

Murderers?? Nothing but just horror genre, and not even original!! Come on netflix... you can do better! Just really dissapointing and right in line with the current satanic end of the world prep agenda. Look at the nice S for Satan, I mean streamberry. And then sort of making demons & murderers look ok?? It's all just a big dissapointment and should come with a warning that this show is NOT family friendly anymore!\n",
            "The spirit of this dystopic show is still alive. Unfortunately only 3 episode.\n",
            "People talks a lot about Black Mirror here and there so i gave it a try. I watched this series with expectations of some mine bending stories but i was disappointed to see only one or two episodes out of 22 episodes consider as \"mind bending\" stories.\n",

            "After five intriguing and thought-provoking seasons delving deep into ethical and moral issues intertwined with potential scenarios driven by technological advancements, the sixth season unfortunately takes us back to the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, completely devoid of any typical technological interventions. In my opinion, this is clearly a step back for the series, which had already gained fame for its unique ideas and execution. The stories in the sixth season are overly simplistic, lacking the depth and complexity that provided ample material for debate and discussion. Several episodes are confined to a limited setting, resulting in constructed narratives that gradually become illogical and hard to bear. I would not recommend this sixth season to anyone who enjoys dark, technology-driven stories, as it lacks any wow factors and compelling narratives.\n",
            "\"Black Mirror\" is an anthological series that, for now, consists of 22 episodes, unequally divided into five irregular seasons. The episodes vary in length, genre, and style and are completely separate short films by different authors. What they have in common is only a general theme - the position in which modern technology puts us and not very optimistic forecasts of its further progress.The \"black mirror\" is in fact the effect that the screens of our monitors, telephones, and TV have when turned off, and symbolically also a dark reflection of our reality and potentially darker future.8/10.\n",
            "Black Mirror is a phenomenal TV series, but it's also deeply unsettling because it explores themes of brutality and humiliation in especially social media platforms, and often has an eerie invasive feel about it. However much it unsettles, it also challenges, so Black Mirror is often as repugnant as it is thought-provoking. Some episodes do indeed go too far and become expressions of anxiety, paranoia and shame rather than having a take-away. I would give Black Mirror 9/10 for that, but on the flip side some episodes can be uniquely transcendent so it is difficult to do that.Black Mirror tackles ideas of cyber crime and the heartlessness that can happen from behind a screen. It talks about cell phone addiction and other kinds of benign-seeming uses of technology that can open the door to catastrophe when used in the wrong way. In particular Black Mirror tackles something we might call \"outrage culture,\" as in the blacklisting of people we don't like. The themes of Black Mirror often do tie into modern day happenings, such as \"canceling\" someone like on Youtube. The series does give you a lot to think about, especially about the punishment of those who occupy a moral gray area.While not always on its A game, Black Mirror has many gems, and is remarkably variable in its scope and in its tone. As others say, however, Black Mirror is hard to binge-watch because it can be unimaginably bleak, and often intentionally so. The series is rather traumatizing and difficult, but often the very bleakness can act as cautionary tales, and help you to be more empathetic and responsible when interacting with people online.I hated Black Mirror, it was miserable, but also I think the series is better than most because there is a responsibility to it, and I do believe it doesn't try to condone its own blackheartedness. I do appreciate the substance of it.I wouldn't say I love Black Mirror, because it's terrifying and sometimes disgusting, but I do appreciate it and admire much of its efforts.\n",
            "It is very well thought most of the time, it shows problems that technology might bring in a very original way but it seems on the verge of technofobia...which I do not agree with.Sometimes it is not clear what it wants to say, there is no meaning to derive...or the problem, practical or ethical , is so far fetched that it doesn't feel realistic!!!\n",
            "I loved the first 5 seasons of Black Mirror and was waiting eagerly to watch season 6 only to be disappointed.I somewhat enjoyed episode1, but it was lacking something and for a BM episode I was overall disappointed.Episode 2 again was somewhat enjoyable but as a BM episode I was expecting a whole lot more.Episode 3 was interesting but again fell short of exciting.Episode 4 was plain BORING despite me loving the actress Zazie Beetz.Episode 5 Was the one I enjoyed the most. It transported me back to early 70's northern England, the music was great, the storyline was enjoyable but again, despite being the most enjoyable episode for me it was still lacking whatever magic Black Mirror usually gives.Pretty forgettable season to be honest. I will always love Black Mirror Season 3 Episode 3 (shut up and dance) because of the actor Alex Lawther who is always a treasure to watch, but after the disappointment of the latest season I thing it's time for the show to end.....unless of course they find their way back to what made the first 5 seasons good..\n",

            "This season continues the move away from the sci-fi themed story telling. Now it's all about how many stars they can sicophantically attach to an episode, or counter balance with a contrived unknown. The stories are just awful, dull, lifeless, almost sporadic in their dullness. It started a few seasons ago, with the famous mullet child \"singer\" and a story about a doll (?), and it's continued descending down, until quite literally it has managed to attract a devil from the lowest pits of hell. Death and Robots has cruised past this roadwreck, and it wouldn't have wrecked if they had just left it as it was at season 3. But they obviously just wanted to suck more cash out of its bloated puffy face, and let's face it, use it as a chance to meet their favorite celebs. This show is now like a pompous art exhibition, with talentles \"celebs\" drifting around, waiting for their own episode, and no doubt being told repeatedly about how amazing they are, and how amazing this episode will be blah blah blah. In reality each season of this has mirrored Charlie Brookers writing talent, and now they are both, just all so passe.\n",

            "Everyone seems to be giving negative reviews. Whether the originality or culture of the beginning of black mirror has somewhat dissipated it does not mean the captivating writing, acting and stories are gone.My biggest reason why I loved black mirror in the first place was the shock and uncertainty each episode brought whether it was based on technology or not. Who cares is what i say. Yes it's a different season but still phenomenal, mysterious and shocking none the less. And again the acting and writing are always on point. Lay off the hate and show some love for such an original series.Each episode of black mirror is a captivating experience in itself. Horror, technology and Gore or not. Every time I start an episode it has always left me with the unexpected. Season 6 included.\n",
            "AT MOST FOUR. Save yourself the pain and frustration.\n",
            "It has gotten so bad. Like Game of Thrones bad. The original creator is still writing the episodes but I feel like all the negative reception (from s1-s3) was because the show is depressing, and that the producers ordered him to make every episode have a happy ending. I feel like Charlie Brooker is on a short-leash and he just doesn't care any more. The show feels completely uninspired, its signature tone has been flipped upside-down, and hardly any episodes since season 3 had any depth whatsoever. It's pretty sad because this was one of my favorites. Hate to see it happen like this but I would never recommend season 4, especially season 5 to anyone.\n",
            "I don't think I've ever seen a show fall off a cliff like this one. Season 1 and 2 were absolutely incredible and even season 3 was pretty good but slowly the show started to degrade. I still recommend everyone watch the early seasons and if you are brave enough to continue into the later seasons, that's your prerogative but be ready to be disappointed. Season 6 is absolutely awful. So bad, in fact that I can't imagine wanting to watch whatever trash they come up with for season 7\n",
            "The writing and acting in season 6 are atrocious. The writing is lazy and intelligent. Some of the episodes could pass for high school writers. The early seasons were well thought out and often had a poingant message that often left me thinking for days. This newer stuff is utter garbage with the viewer being bludgeoned by the message at every turn. Subtlety and good story telling have been replaced. It's so sad to see the creativity of a once bold show get sucked out like this.\n",
            "I have wondered around Netflix up and down, have watched all that I have found in my way that I could consider of a certain quality at a first glimpse or by the reviews, sadly or I don't know why, I never heard of Black Mirror. By accident I stumbled with the name while wondering for something worth investing a couple of hours and decided to give it a try without ever knowing anything about it, and oh boy!!!! What a hidden treasure it turned out to be!, I still cannot believe I didn't know about this collection of chapters, each one a work of art. Great stories, great acting, great directors. To me in particular some of them are just mesmerizing, authentic, some truly terrifying and some very sadly so truthful. This show shows you the dark side of the happy image we want to always portray and the \"perfect\" future we r working on.\n",

People are saying these new episodes aren't Black Mirror. They are exactly Black Mirror. Every one of them makes you think. I don't rewatch shows and I've been wanting to rewatch them.It annoys me how people are saying they love this show and want more seasons but leave terrible reviews. Well... do you think we will get more if everyone leaves bad reviews???? No. Support the show. Don't bash it!I loved it! Please give us more seasons!\n",

            "I think it's pretty much legendary how off putting the 1st episode of Black Mirror is. I have had so many friends tell me they saw that first episode and didn't watch any more.That's sad because there are some truly great episodes. In particular Season 1 episode 3, Season 2 episode 4, all of season 3. But much of the rest is so-so to just poor. Season 4 was a let down. The first 3 seasons for the most part, every episode was \"OMG, that really could happen if we aren't careful how we use new tech\" but Season 4 had none of that. Instead it was just kind of like a Creepshow-esqe anthology of random tech based horror-ish skits.Season 5 had one interesting episode, episode 1, though it had a poor resolution.So, the good episodes are truly great, must watch TV. But the rest drags it down. As such it doesn't deserve the 9/10s many are giving in IMO.\n",
            "Season 6 was like watching \"Tales From The Crypt\" or \"Tales From The Darkside\" or that awful newer series \"American Horror Stories\". Other than episodes 1 & 3, this season didn't even remotely feel like i was watching \"Black Mirror\". What a complete letdown. For some reason, with the exception of episodes 1 & 3, the writers decided to go in the direction of the bad horror and exploitation movies of the 70s and early 80s. Episode 1, although more in line with a traditional Black Mirror episode was a complete mess - especially the last five minutes. If Salma Hayek knew she had signed the contract and was appearing as \"TV Joan\", I'm not sure why anyone else wouldn't also recall signing a contract to also appear as a \"TV Joan\". Episode 3 was also more in line with a traditional \"Black Mirror\" episode but it just couldn't save the entire season.\n",

And the fact that all the episodes deal with some negative side-effect from technology makes it relevant. But even though I definitely believe the technological possibilities proposed in the episodes, I certainly can't believe the human aspect. The behavior of the characters is farfetched, unbelievable. Exactly in that sense: I don't believe them.I guess this would categorise the series as 'horror', scary things happen and the characters overreact and do silly things, things that people wouldn't do in reality. And there's the snag for me: the series seems to want to use something from reality, technology, to scare us, yet fails to do so because of the characters' responses. There also is a strange focus on certain themes that seem to be the biggest horror to the creators of the show, and they are usually very sexual. Mostly men having to deal with the woman they love not having sex with them.I'd like to see this show grow. I'd like it to become more 'thriller' instead of 'horror'. I want to actually believe these things could happen. Well... only for an hour or so ;) \n",
            "I'd like to see this show grow and create storylines that involve more variant fears, and I can see they seem to be doing this. Hear, hear!So yes, please, go on. I cant' wait for the creators to really scare me silly... in the future.\n",
            "The first 4 seasons were full of creative and interesting stories while the fifth had a clear w___ agenda with poor writing like many other shows now.I'd say the phase but I'm sure they are filtering reviews based on all the 10 reviews. This is a good show , a 6 to 7 at most not at the level of the 90s Outer Limits great stories. Another good show ruined.\n",
            "If you really enjoy indulging your depression, feelings of paranoia about society, and hatred of technology, you'll probably like this show. If, like me, you don't, you'll find this series utterly unwatchable. I'm a huge fan of The Twilight Zone, and for those that try to compare Black Mirror to it, what on Earth are you talking about? TZ had social commentary, sure, but it was renowned for great plots with ironic or twist endings, not poorly drawn out plots that leave you drained of all joy. Which is what Black Mirror does every single episode. Like I said, unless you enjoy that type of entertainment, avoid this garbage.\n",

It's like a very bad, and weak remake of the original.The only episode worthy of this show, from season 4, was the last one. This one is the only one, that really felt like black mirror.

            "** This review contains spoilers **I was trying to find a new series to watch on Netflix, and, missing the amazing (but deceptive) Jinni, browsed 'similarshows'. This show came up as one of one of four 'Mind Boggling Shows Like The X-Files'. I never really got into X-Files, but quite liked the bits I saw. IMDb's score (for BM) was 8.9, so I thought it was well worth checking out.. Big mistake. similarshows certainly got the 'mind boggling' aspect right, but they missed the word 'awful'. If only I'd checked the reviews here first, as some share my view and would've warned me. Not only was the main theme of the first episode repulsive, it was completely ridiculous. I guess I'm one of those who 'missed the messages... ' '...the relationship between technology and psychology'.. Well the tech. fell down for me when they didn't realise a dismembered finger was actually a man's; and as for the psychology: man kidnaps girl, man makes fantastically ridiculous demands, PM says no, one of his staff makes incredibly stupid mistake, his subordinates say he must comply, his wife cries, he decides he will (or more accurately, he's bullied into it), evidence is available to show the man is unlikely to kill the girl but they ignore it, everyone, including the kids, watches 'the act' on national TV, at tea time. 'It' apparently goes on for over an hour, then afterwards they find out that the guy released the girl before the act had begun, then topped himself. Maybe I am missing something, but I really can't see much depth to it at all. I found the psychology of 'The Fall' deep, immersive and disturbing. Not this.I'm not a big fan of watching more of something that's rubbish (imo) just to see if it gets better.. If that's what floats the creators' boats (and a multitude of viewers who thought it was 'outstanding' (as did the Emmy's it seems), 'brilliant' and 'the best show ever', I'll jump ship.\n",

            " So i watched all 3 seasones at the time and couldn't wait for next, then forgot about it until ... until season 4 came out ... at first all seems so familiar (atmosphere, dark/light scenes contrast, etc), but (no, BUT!) story didnt develope through the episode (watched 2 episodes so far), it was monotone with no chill going through my spine, no explicite scenes and it doesn't make you think (you just don't give a damn about episode, about ending, about subject in it) ... such disappointment\n",

            "(Rating for the full series is a 9 so far, 8/10 for the sixth season).Black Mirror is a classic TV show at this stage, a bold dystopic depiction of how our relationship with technology can take some really dark turns and be the cause of some bizarre and scary situations in our future.But Black Mirror is way more than just a show about the bad effects of technology in our society since it also explores some really interesting themes of human behavior, I would argue that this is actually what the show is about, how we humans will behave when equipped with these new technical tools with an infinite amount of potential, and let me tell you, based on the dark minds of the people behind the show the future seems really gruesome!Being an anthology all episodes are completely independent from each other, some are way better than others so its hard to rate an entire season since some of the best episodes are scattered among all six of them (so far).The show usually mixes drama with suspense, mystery and sometimes a slight pinch of comedy, but one thing is certain, your anxiety levels will without a doubt be continuously high for most episodes.As I mentioned you have amazing episodes across the series, sometimes it's due to the technology being highly creative, other times its just that the story is really amazing in any case they are for the most part compelling episodes.You have some that seem a bit pointless or its hard to understand the underlying message but overall its a really great concept.Addressing this last season in particular, I really enjoyed it, in comparison to the previous one which felt a bit blend it amped up its game, curiously enough there were a few episodes that went a bit outside of your usually technology driven narrative but contrary to what people are saying it wasn't completely void of it - two of them are social commentary about streaming services which lets not forget might not be advanced tech to today's standards but its a major technological revolution.And the last episode was completely outside of your usual Black Mirror type but was really good, it was more of a psychological / horror approach but I really found it enjoyable, great character chemistry! The series doesn't have a roadmap its okay to go a bit outside of the standard from time to time specially in an anthology TV show.Go watch the sixth season and don't be stuck in the pre conceived ideas of what it should look like, enjoy the change - with this being said if they keep doing more seasons I do hope they go for more grim technological scenarios in the future as some of the classic old school ones of the early seasons!\n",
            "This is a show like none other i have ever seen in my life. The descriptions says its Sci-fi show, but the story line makes the technology part take a back seat and show cases how humans can be cruel and petrifying in a way never imagined before. This show is not for the faint-hearted though, it gets really dark and horrifying. Though not supernatural some episodes like \"Be Right Back\" and \"White bear\" will petrify even the strongest of nerves.\n",
            "Black Mirror is a uniquely bleak sci-fi drama that delves into the darkness of future(istic) technology. It provides a cynical but also grounded view by how some concepts that seem great to have in theory, could destroy many relationships, humans and more. But. This goes for the first 3 seasons and partly 4th season. The show has dropped off significantly and has lost it's identity sadly.I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. But here we go. I just finished season 6. And I have to say, this show is done. It's heyday's are over. Up until season 4 (if I'm a bit more harsh S3) it's such a unique and enjoyable show exploring the darkness of tech. It was creative, at times a gut punch, emotional, well acted and directed. It was all there. After S4 it started to feel like ''shorts'' that overstay their welcome and don't really hook into the core identity of the show. And it lost me.If I would recommend anyone the show it would be to watch till season 3 for the essentials. Episodes such as ''The Entire History of You'' ''White Bear'' ''Be Right Back'' ''White Christmas'' ''San Junipero'' (my favorite) and more, you honestly can't go wrong with any episode of the first 3 seasons. Season 4 started showing signs of regression.San Junipero deserves a special shoutout, that episode stuck with me for weeks. It's a incredibly well done episode and to it's core based on such a strong emotional foundation. Death, life, existentialism. For me it was an episode that made me reflect and ask questions to myself. A sign of a strong episode. Now in contrast, San Junipero could be a seen as out of place in the lineup of S1-3 episodes. As it's not depressing in a traditional sense for the show. But... uniquely depressing in a happy way, if that makes any sense.Overall, though, the show has great direct, lovely acting and always felt solid all around. Just fantastic. It does hold the standard throughout most seasons. Some episodes here and there feel weaker than others, as is expected with a anthology series. But I don't remember crazy poor performances or sloppy episodes in a technical sense.This show has had episodes I will never forget. And that's worth something. Sadly, the last couple seasons were dull and I'm done with giving the show a chance each time. The writing just isn't there anymore.\n",

            "It could have been fun.The main idea - all people are really bad. Even comically bad and stupid. And with technology they become even more evil and stupid.This is so primitive. But even this could have been executed in much better ways.It becomes stale so fast.\"Okay, lets watch some black mirror. In what other way I am going to be told the same thing?\"And because of this strange \"agenda\", every episode becomes more and more bizarre.Even funny in a bad way.And really-really boring.\n",
            "So, this popped up on my recommended viewing list on Netflix... didn't know what I was in for, just bored and needed something to binge on.What a surprise! I just finished the third episode and am going to move on to more... really looking forward to seeing more! They are all separate stories with a common theme (so far): Technology and humanity.From the title, I guessed it would be dark. But this really delves into what is so F'd up with society and just what technology is doing to us; a little scary and quite enlightening.I wouldn't recommend it for a first date night, but if you want to watch something to just reflect on while enjoying some fantastic acting, brilliant writing, or just to binge a little... or a lot, you're gonna be blown away. I'm sitting here writing this, still just a little disturbed at what I have watched. This is really one of those series that you just watch by yourself, with no distractions.\n",

            "####Season 4 update (02/08/19). Season 5 came out last month and I'm still dawdling around S4, Ep5/6. This is the way I watch BM - by watching one episode very infrequently and taking some months to recover from the enormity of the (let's hope erroneous) prediction. Still no better SciFi in 2019 IMHO.####I generally supply good reviews, however, very few TV series, films will ever get a rating of 10/10 from me. Black Mirror is one of those TV series.As a fan of Sci-Fi (i.e. Ray Bradbury, Phillip K. Dick two of my all time fave authors), the writing in Black Mirror (BM) is deserving of accolades accorded to the aforementioned greats. BM brings into sharp focus the trajectory humanity *could be* on (see Prof Stuart Kauffman's concept of the 'adjacent possible') and extrapolates beyond our current smartphone reality to an altogether (sometimes) grimmer collection of alternative higher-tech futures. BM is great Sci-Fi for this principal reason. The cinematography provides some stunning visuals (Ep 4 - San Junipero) and perfectly blends periods across the time hopping story lines of some episodes.

I understand that the US is going through some kind of identity crisis but don't inflict it on the rest of us. It must be so hard in the US to make a series these days without casting which has no relevance to the story or helps move the story along. But what can you expect from Netflix these days. Then there are the stories... what a yawn fest and after trying episode 2 just gave up. Do yourself a favour and go watch the old series they were so much better!\n",

As a result, there's not overarching narrative here, but more of a unifying concept. The episodes are variable in their quality and shock-factor, certainly the original seasons where better. There's some less appealing episodes (e.g. The one which features Miley Cyrus) and more climactic episodes which result in some shocking revelations at the end.

Every episode of that season was absolutely brilliant.But season 6: Joan is Awful, Loch Henry, Mazey Day, Demon 79, and Beyond the Sea far exceeded my expectations. Every episode was like watching an individual movie. Simply amazing!And I like the inclusion of the Red Mirror variant (Demon 79).

This is just our present reality, so it's not much of a stretch to empathize with the female protagonist of the episode, as she has her privacy shattered and her life, let's say, roundly and creatively exploited for the enjoyment of the masses and the profit of the provider and it's CEO.The tragedy and comedy that ensue are so clever and engaging that as the show progressed (let's just say, past the halfway point) I was absolutely delighted with what I'd watched thus far and and absolutely convinced I knew how it would deliciously end.

Additionally,with such a variety of writers and directors, the range of styles and methods of execution make it a collage. The common threads are the producer, a dystopian view and British film/TV Movie making sensibility.Many episodes could stand on their own as full theatrical releases. A few need not have been made. Taken in its entirety, the body of work is genius. It will likely remain viable for generations as the technologies foreseen will be compared to the similar technologies that will become reality. Where Series such as Star Trek and Star Wars futurist views are defined by the movie making technology of the time, this series is defined by the creative talent and imagination of the production staff. Like I said, British. Fortunately, this wasn't (or has not yet) been f'd up by Hollywood.Reading some of the reviews are, as other non US series of movies, not fully appreciated by the US audience. It lacks the typical banality and requires an intellect or education level beyond the US electorate to fully appreciate the work.Clue, there's no laugh track or formula or predicable outcome.

            "Fear of technology. That is what this series seem to represent. How we are all enslaved by science and technology, which will ultimately doom us all. Black mirror is basically fearmongering, especially about social media. Almost every single episode's underlying theme is how facebook and twitter is this vile cesspool that only brings out the absolute worst in people and only spawns trolls, bullies and terrorists, a system that makes us all soulless total psychopaths reveling in mass murder and human suffering.Black Mirror seems to be made by old people. The kind, who only have a cursory understanding of modern technology, probably from the news and conspiracy nut blogs, and they envision this formless evil beast that will inevitably destroy humanity. We all fear what we don't understand, and the creators of this series are just bringing this concept to the extreme. You can see it in every episode: social media is evil tyranny, modern medical and scientific advances are just waiting to kill us all, and where one single person is enough to hack some automated system and go on a killing spree, while the authorities are just fumbling about completely powerless. Aside from one single episode, Season 3's \"San Junipero\", the entirety of Black mirror is totally ridiculous, pandering fearmongering, that exploits people's lack of knowledge about technology and sends a completely wrong message. This sort of luddite thinking and behavior is what lead to the Dark Ages...Having said all that, Black Mirror is a surprisingly well put- together series. The production value is very high, and for a sci-fi TV series, the CGI is remarkably good. The stories (discounting the subject matter) are well written and well acted. Some of the episodes tend to be sluggish and boring in places, but I chalk that up to the creators, who seem to be from the old-school sci-fi scene with strong hints of Stanislaw Lem and Phillip K. Dick influences.All in all, Black Mirror is very well made sci-fi series, that is just a bit too on the nose about it's hatred for modern technology and especially social media. It's definitely worth a watch if you can distance yourself from the ridiculous fearmongering.\n",
            "The storyline of the recent seasons of Black Mirror falls short of the thought-provoking narratives that characterized its earlier seasons, particularly during its run on Channel 4. The show, which once delved deep into themes exploring reality, government influence, and the power of technology and pharmaceutical corporations, seems to have been stripped of its original essence.With Netflix at the helm, the show appears to have lost its ability to challenge viewers and question the narratives dictated by those in power. Instead, the focus seems to be solely on generating shock value within each individual story, without truly delving into the implications and reflections of our own reality.While Season 6 did show some improvement in terms of storyline, it failed to capture the same captivating essence that Season 1 and 2 brought to the table under Channel 4. Those earlier episodes had a remarkable ability to ignite conversations among friends and family, leaving an indelible impact that urged us to contemplate the world we live in.It is disheartening to witness the influence of a nanny corporate state on a show like Black Mirror. One could argue that this very shift reflects the artistry of the series itself, mirroring the erosion of personal freedoms and our diminished capacity to question the actions of the elite in our own reality.In the current climate, where genuine thought-provoking content is often compromised, it is a lamentable sign of the times. Black Mirror, once a beacon of intellectual stimulation, seems to have lost its way in the pursuit of sensationalism, forsaking the vital role it once played in allowing viewers to question and challenge the status quo.\n",

            "Well directed, tension builds and builds. However, the whilst the Episodes are good but they a definitively nor futuristic, rather they are more current conspiracies. THERE is NO futuristic aspect to the majority of the episodes - no sci-fi aspect. Sadly, disappointed.Subject matter has the potential to be futuristic, however, the content is more occult/ wolverine. This franchise has lost it's focus, lost it's way. It needs new righters to be keep the franchise as it set out to be: set in the future with innovative twists. Currently, this series is so far away from the remit it needs to be called something else. It is not worthy of the esteemed hallmark of a Black Mirror.\n",

We stopped in the middle of No.4 ... the first episode, called \"Joan is awful\" is still quite good (although during the end there are some smaller logic errors) - never mind, it's exactly in the tradition.

Start with season 1 and stop after last episode of season 5.Season 6 is so bad and lame it's a joke.Not just that actors are bad (they've put Selma Hayek in one episode and on the promo image as a clickbait and that's the only episode watchable and actually contains psychological effects), other episodes stories are off and not ,,black mirrory,, at all. It's like producers made them in a hurry with no passion or regards to the Black mirror concept.So disappointing. Just enjoy S1-S5 and stop right there.\n",

            "What we have here is a show which is a disturbing commentary on the way that technology could lead society down a route that shapes our societies in a way that we never wanted it to. If you're new to the show, don't be put off by the first episode. First of all, it is probably the least Black Mirror like episode, but also consider that just because it is disturbing (as anyone in their right mind would say), it does say a lot about the people using that technology. Currently as of October 2018, there are 4 series out and series 1 and 2 are purely based in England and series 3 and 4 are mixed between England and the United States (although sometimes filmed elsewhere). The tone of the show definitely changes, but not necessarily in a bad way, however the American episodes seem to be somewhat glossier made though don't have quite the storyline that the English episodes have. For series 5, I'd like to see some more money spent on those episodes based in England. The episodes are consistently well thought out, though sometimes \"a leap of faith\" is required in the odd episode as the concepts don't fully add up if you scratch beneath the surface. It does however provide excellent drama. This is up there with 'Breaking Bad' for being a well written series with ideas that are there to challenge our ways. A lot of people give a lot of credit to Charlie Brooker, but I'd also like to add Annabelle Jones and other contributors. If you watch it and feel that you can't watch any more as it is too sick, give it a day or two and watch some more.\n",

            "Black Mirror is a series of episodes that are not related to one another except for the fact that each of them deals with some aspect of how technology is able to shape human life.Reviewing this series would be like trying to review all nature programs. Some are about insects, others might be about outer space. The only common theme is the natural world.Some of these episodes leave you full of hope for what will be possible in our lifetimes. Most of them leave you worried. Although I would say that overall they paint a bleak picture of what's coming, they would best be viewed as a reminder that we humans often fail to anticipate the ultimate consequence of our actions and discoveries. They show us that we can find ourselves in situations where we as a species walked inexorably into our own doom, unable to stop our march.Such instances have already occurred in history, an example thereof would be the development of nuclear weapons. Although their existence is a threat to human life, it seems that for the time being we are unable to get rid of them. Think about it. They are not a virus, we have the capacity to destroy them, but our current political standpoint makes it hard for it to happen. Fussing with human genome has so far been avoided, but we have the technology and we only need one country to open this Pandora box. Same thing with AI. It seems that there is no way to stop the advances in AI, as it is advantageous for every country to invest in it, and countries that don't will be left behind. I don't think we have the capacity to even make a pause and think a bit, because there would certainly be someone else pursuing it, so we all walk inevitably to the further development of an evermore capable computer intelligence.We live in a world where it is impossible for each of us to see the bigger picture as the specialization we are subjected too only allows us to be experts in a tiny area of knowledge, and this series alerts us to the possibility of unimaginable pain that we are going to be able to inflict on ourselves in a future that we will be able to see during our lifetimes.\n",

They are boring, predictable, drag on forever, pretentious, and the philosophical ideas presented are so basic you could show them to a bunch of preschoolers and they'd understand perfectly well. Most epsiodes come with a \"twist\" that you see coming from a mile away and is presented as way more dramatic than it really is.I seriously cannot understand the hype over this.

Now most episodes are just a bunch of regular random short stories involving murder and supernatural elements, what does not resemble the previous seasons in any way. A complete change of bearing to the ultimate loss of hardcore fans of the series. For starters, the season contains only 5 episodes, 3 of them having nothing to do with science fiction or \"Black Mirrors\" (what I suppose is an allusion to the screens present on modern devices). I hope Netflix realises what went wrong and fixes it in the next seasons. Otherwise we might just go watch the \"Dust\" channel on YouTube instead.\n",
            "REVIEW FOR SEASON 5Only three episodes for Season 5, makes me wonder if they blew most of their budget so they could get those big name stars. Each episode is more than an hour each, though, so watching the season is like watching a long 3-part movie.The first one, \"Striking Vipers\" was basically \"Brokeback Mountain\" with black people, plus another twist. It showed how much worst Catfishing will be as technology improves.The next one \"Smithereens\" was a mystery-tragedy, with the mystery being the why a guy had to kidnap an employee of a Social Media company, with the tragedy when we finally learned the reason why.The last one, \"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too\" was sort of an adventure thriller which also gave us a peek on how technology could affect the entertainment industry in the future.In fairness, all the big name stars like Anthony Mackie, Topher Grace and Miley Cyrus did great in their episodes, and probably well worth their talent fees. A solid season, wished there were more episodes, though.\n",
            "I gave it a good go, it's slow and boring with no fantastic ending to make up for it.If you're someone who already watches a lot of 'out there' programmes be it futuristic Sci fi, dark humour, horrors then you will not like this show, It will bore you.I've read through some reviews people wrote that being shocked was the point of the show, I wasn't shocked, I was bored. I tried a couple of episodes in series 1 and one episode in series 4 just to see if it got better, Arkangel was awful.\n",
            "My choice for the film review is Black Mirror - British science fiction anthology television series created by Charlie Brooker where the series are not related to each other by plot, actors, time or place of narration. According to Brooker, all the subjects unite only satire on the way of life that is prevalent in the modern society. The cross - cutting theme is the influence of information technology on human relations. The series shows the modern life of mankind and all the problems that technological innovations bring to people's lives. In each series, people can recognize themselves. Black Mirror shows the world where technology burst into human life and took a solid place. Without computers, TVs, laptops, phone and other electronic devices people cannot imagine their lives. This kind of technique is called the \"Black Mirror\" of mankind. The World Wide Web has captured the billions people in its networks. Social networks swallowed the youth up. And it has already reached the point close to the situation where people cannot see the difference between reality and virtuality. During watching Black Mirror, person will see a realistic picture of the modern world, where people are ruled by technology. In order to clearly show the world with its own norms which is shown in Black Mirror, I will provide as an example one of the episodes of this serial which is called \"Nosedive\" - Series 3, Episode 1, where the whole life revolves around the rating in the social networks. High rating gives you a discount on the purchase of the real estate, luxury seats in an airplane, and the possibility of rapid career growth. The rating defines to which social class person belongs to; the higher ratings person has the more respect, kindness and privilege he receives. But the issue is that people in that world are ready to go on with a strained smile and fake feelings all their lives and forget about sincerity only in order to make their ratings to be on the top. If draw the parallel between our world and the world, represented in the episode \"Nosedive\", it will be obvious that there is a huge difference in the ways of living. In these two different worlds people have different concepts of norms of behavior; what is normal for \"Nosedive\" world, it is abnormal for our world. For example, if we make friends for the reason that we love them and enjoy the time spent with them, in the world from the series people are communicating with you only because someone has the high ratings in the social network. The significance of the ratings in the social network is so high, that the world became feigned in all senses. These kinds of norms which are being followed by the world from the \"Nosedive\" episode are abnormal for the world we are living in. Norm it is a standard of appropriate behavior, but since different societies have different standards, it can be concluded that they follow different norms which could be abnormal for others but normal for themselves.\n",
            "Not every episode is equally fantastic but even the weaker ones stand out as great television compared to 99% of what's out there otherwise.If you want to give it a try, then start with The Entire History of You, which probably embodies the spirit of this anthology best.Nosedive is a little closer to reality but will still wreck your nerves.If you want to see how reality has already caught up with futurism, watch The Waldo Moment, actually one of the worst episodes.For Black Mirror in full display, watch White Bear, 15 million merits or San Junipero.For an overdose: watch White Christmas, three BM stories in one.Oh, well, watch all of them. You won't regret it.\n",

Loch Henry started... \"what happens?\" \"You've got to tell me!\" \"If you don't I will watch an episode that you haven't seen, and tell you about it\" I like to know what's happening so I can relax and enjoy the programme, otherwise it's too tense she says, so I tell her....

            "This series feels so relevant to our current world and has actually made me want to shun social media and modern technology. Cultures and settings are interchangeable and there is never any indication of where it's shot or whether it's set in the future or modern day, which only adds to the other worldliness of the series. Charlie Brooker himself has said that the title is based on an idea that when we look into a black (switched off) computer screen it reflects a dark shadow back to us. This shadow form accurately reflects the darker recesses of the human mind as depicted by the show's protagonists. Episodes vary dramatically however this theme is always beautifully maintained throughout. The writing is so intelligent and thought-provoking to the point where the message stays with you long after viewing. Very few series make me feel fully immersed in the storytelling like this one does and I'm already itching for the next season. Intelligent writing, beautifully executed.\n",

            "Black Mirror is an anthology show where a whole bunch of different stories take place. There's elements of horror, sci-fi, survival and others contained in 4, soon to be 5, seasons of 6 episodes each. Each episode is self-contained in that they don't touch on any of the other episodes except in the most superficial way. For example in more than one episode they make reference to \"brown suede\" as a style of coffee. But there's no specific callbacks to any specific episode. It's more like these all take place within a shared universe.There is a certain amount of darkness to it, after all it's not called \"Black Mirror\" for nothing. Social commentary is a thing and they use the show to reference this. Whether it's our addiction to things like Facebook, Instagram and how others see us all of these things are spoken of in one way or another. I seriously tell anybody not to binge watch this as easy as it might be for you to do. Take the time to think about and digest the information and what the episode was trying to say and give yourself some time before firing up the next one.\n",
            "Why makers wanted to show only this? Why it should always have a sad and terrible ending which we can can't even bear. This show literally makes us feel so bad being a human as it always concentrates on the darkest side of human with inhumane scenes. Seriously disappointing and depressing series till date but though the concept and idea execution is exceptional. But still what is the purpose of a story telling when you are deciding that it's gone go so bad that nothing is going to save you and this is how it ends. Any story should give us a sense of hope not just crap of society with a disturbing ending.\n",

Some are really clever, others just plain silly. Fortunately, for the binge watcher, they can easily skip through the rubbish episodes, and also fast forward through the long drawn out bits that offer little relevance to the main theme.

But when these compete with each other to give us the best content, we can't help but be in awe. Like in any other season the latest season consists of a bunch of standalone episodes. Some episodes have some familiar faces in terms of TV celebs. Each episode speaks about the perils of technology & how adversely it will affect us in the future.

For many I would suggest skipping the first episode and re-visiting it later when you have become a little more hardened to this type of show. Most of the one star reviews of this show are from folks totally repulsed by the first episode. It hits them so hard they couldn't cope!Every episode of this show sends you a message from the writer. Sometimes that message is not welcomed....but it should always make you think!The overall concept of the show is that technology is not a positive improvement in our lives.....the writer occasionally admits that it could be, if used properly (season 3, ep 4), but for the most part we are better off without technology, because it will be abused!This is a show for the thinking person, who has a strong heart!

For a while, Parent Guiding certification (PG-13, etc...) had been enough to the majority of mainstream production companies out of ''risky'' markets such as R-rated movies, TV-MA shows and the likes, because the consensus was that they were missing out on full market capitalization with their content ; Making movies/tv for a part of the market was less lucrative than targeting broader range of audiences.  However, today, because of the abundance of media content, we see a market that is split into multiple sub-genres with a loyal following that will often barely venture out it's own personal preferences, if at all ; If one of those sub-genre gets a large enough representation, However Niche and unusual it is, Content is gonna be produced and producers will capitalize on the market opportunity. \n",

            " What we get is a bunch of ruthless TV shows, like Black Mirror, like Game of Thrones, etc...

            "  Review Black Mirror, is a built on a bold concept. At it's core, the show takes contemporary concepts and technologies, enhances them and builds realistic, dystopian-societies, set in the near future, around those technologies. It's purpose is to demonstrate that technology and power are not good nor evil. They are simply tools, used as an extension of the wielder's will. ANY technology can and WILL be used for Creation and/or Destruction given the right circumstances. Being an Anthology series, it gives the show the ability to visit a lot of different worlds and societies. As a sci-fi fan, the opportunity to explore as much individual, unrelated universes as possible, each containing their own set of characters and stories to explore is a feeling that can't be explained. The show can be enjoyed for what it is, an explicit demonstrations of the eventual problems associated with modern day technology through dystopian societies closely resembling our own, misusing enhanced version of the devices we use everyday. In that sense, it plays as an original Sci-fi, Drama, Thriller with a lot of plot twists.\n",
            " \n",
            " However, It can also be enjoyed for what it represents, and that's the best way to enjoy it in my opinion. It's fascinating to see how a lot of the things we take for granted and assume is harmless or to improve society and human condition is merely a perspective, and the show makes a very good job a demonstrating that point ; I've never been more scared of X-factor, Facebook and Brain Electrodes...\n",
            " \n",
            " What's interesting is that even though a lot of these world feel incredibly alien, they still feel somewhat familiar and instinctive, because they are built around how the human race dealt with a concept or technology in the past, leading to such extreme changes in comparison with todays society, even though, they are not set that far appart in time. \n",
            " \n",
            " What's amazing, is that every one of those societies is a possible outcome for our own human race. The problems and dysfunctions at the root of each dystopian societies portrayed in Black Mirror are based on current issues, and the way we do or do not deal with them will help shape tomorrow's society into what could be an aberration of it's former self, as shown in Many Episodes of Black Mirror. I personally enjoyed the lack of a regular cast that appears in every episode. I think that ongoing character development associated with a recurring character in a TV show encourages lazy writing, because they can always change something or add some flash-back to fix an issue with character/plot. Being an anthology series, each episode is a definitive, final version of a story, including it's protagonists. It also plays as a motivator for actors to give good performances, as they only appear in a single episode (for the most part). I was also pleasantly surprised to see a lot of quality, established actors. The best episode of pretty much every season as been the finale, which to me, indicates that the show's producers are in touch with what makes their show successful and good, especially in an anthology series where the finale's appreciation is not influenced by plot cliff-hangers or events that have been built-up for a whole season. This means hey are likely going to be able to replicate their formula for years to come, and that they didn't just get lucky. On top of that, the Show's success could attract big name actors as the format of the show is not overwhelming on an actor's calendar This is the TV show I've been wanting for years without knowing it. I've seen so many movies/tv-shows that presented original, intelligent, ambitious concepts, but ended up compromising what made them special to comply to social conventions. Swapping their bold eccentricity, mid movie for sheer, bland normality. Thankfully, that time has come to an end we can finally see how alien, twisted, and scary the world could be or have been, with a push in the right direction.\n",
            "Didn't care for the first 3 episodes but it gets better with episodes 4, 5 and 6. I give the whole season a 6 minus.episode 1 is about social media. I absolutely hated it. Community did way better with a lot more satire in the 8th episode \"App Development and Condiments\" of season 5. episode 2 didn't feel like a black mirror episode and the lead is so annoying it's painful to watch.episode 3 is not subversive, not new and pretty boring Then things start to get better with episode 4 and finished grandiosely with features length episode 5. TL;DR : skip episode 1-3 and watch'em letter if you get bored.\n",
            "It's time to take a look in the mirror yourself. Season 5 episode 1 rates 6 stars. Episode 2 what a weak boring plot. Episode 3 really?Where did the money go? Instead of developing a good season you gave it all to a C-class actor who sings?!\n",
            "One of the Best series which can keep you entangled with standalone episodes. Been on my watch list for years. But once I started it I never knew how it all ended just in a day.

Most of its individual episodes have great stories and meaning behind them, they have originality. Even the worst episodes in season one are watchable and have some level of entertainment. The first season has lots of re-watchability to it. But then they released the second season. It's got plenty of episodes with cool concepts but they drag on. I, and many other people, felt let-down by the subsequent season. So far it only has eight episodes, and those eight episodes feel like they were episodes cut from the first season. It isn't horrible, but once you see it all, you don't want to watch it again. Its worst episodes are unbearable and its best are inferior compared to the first season. It contains episodes where the characters make dumb decisions, and its got plenty of episodes that are hard to understand.With all of that said, I'm giving it a 7/10 because the first season is so good. 9/10 for the first season and 5/10 for the second.\n",
            "I feel like some of the episodes in season 2 were a little too short, and there were less than half as many episodes as season 1, so all in all season 2 was a little disappointing. It's not bad; season 1 just set the bar too high.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, though.\n",
            "Fantastic frist season, good stories. Was really looking forward to season 2, but four episodes in , its looking very disapointing.\n",
            "I really liked season 1 of the series: a new kind of format, amazing graphics, sometimes thought provoking and serious, even dark, sometimes just simply funny. Diverse themes and animation styles. It was kind of like Black Mirror, but animated. Or like reading a collections sci-fi short stories.But season 2... I was looking forward to it so much, and it let me down. The animations are as good as in season 1, and there is one or two episodes that are kind of OK, but otherwise they have forgotten *the* most important thing that made season 1 so good: the stories. I don't know what they were thinking, but they are very basic in season 2, sometimes do not even make sense. The punch lines are basically missing, or very weak.Season 1 = 10 starts. Season 2 = 3 stars.\n",
            "Clearly created both by and for a generation that has grown up deeply embedded in video games, Love, Death & Robots inevitably seems to reflect a similar drop in attention span and a curiously singleminded focus on surface shocks and flashy spectacle at the expense of everything else. Indeed, the storylines (and animation) often feel like little more than intros to games, with as much depth, believability and emotion.The visuals are, admittedly, continually impressive, but there's really almost nothing at all supporting them: the dialogue is lame, cliched and forgettable throughout, the storytelling very weak, practically every joke falls flat, and the voice acting is gratingly amateurish more often than not.It's clear comparisons will be drawn between this and, say, Black Mirror, in that they are both comprised of short, standalone stories dealing mostly with technology and the future, but unlike Black Mirror, at no point does any episode make you think deeply about... well, anything, and no idea raised is fleshed out enough to feel you've been shown anything of any worth. The good news is that, since the episodes are only 15 minutes long anyway, you don't feel particularly cheated, at least at first, but after you've watched a bunch of them, you do begin to wonder what the point of it all is.The better episodes are The Witness, Suits and Shape-Shifters, so I'd recommend checking those out first if curious.\n",
            "Once you start watching, you can't stop until it's over\n",
            "I am not a fan at all of animation stuff, nor modern scifi and fantasy too. But this series which was advised by a friend amazes me, because it is so gloomy, dark, disturbing, maybe too complex though, that I am addicted to it. Unfortunately, most of those stories could not be adapted for the big screen in classic regular movies. Too shocking for most audiences. I highly recommand it to anyone seeking something different. Don't expect happy endings here, no do not, you would be deceived. Or maybe once in a while.\n",
            "Third season in my opinion is much better, story and enternteinment wise, than second season. But none can compare to the first one, obviously.One review mentions this season being dark and dreary... well dooh, it's in the name \"Love, DEATH + Robots\". After season 1, I expect this show to be dark(Death) with some hope(Love) sprinkled in and taking a background and sometimes just for fun Robots added.Only disappointment that it's just 9 episodes.\n",
            "Season 1, a mind blowing masterpiece with plenty of episodes to indulge. Season 2, a disgrace to season 1. Not only is it incredibly short after a 2 year wait, but the writing is just sloppy. Season 1 had a lot of episodes that made you think \"wow, how does someone come up with this\" while season 2 as a whole seems like something you could scrap together with a couple friends over a weekend.I pray this is a lesson to the people who decided to switch up this season, and that if they do get another chance with a third that they redeem themselves. There are great writers and artists out there who are forced to have limited creativity. LET THEM MAKE SOMETHING FREELY.\n",
            "Season 1 was an absolutely masterpiece but wtf was season 2?! It felt like teasers with no plots but with a vine time limit of 7 seconds... disappointing asf.\n",
            "Although I'd still say that this season is worth watching, I have to also say that it is most definitely nowhere near as good as season 1.First of all, stories of S2 are best described as \"meah\". Aside from the e3 and e4 (that were somewhat interesting and\\or thought-provoking) and e6 that made me chuckle a bit, the rest are completely forgettable.Second, this season seams to be positively muted in terms of sheer madness and creative scope of the first one. Why this is would be anybody's guess, but my sense is that the network decided to play it safe instead of embracing the sometimes-provocative insanity of the first season.Finally, this season contains less than half the number of episodes of the first one, why??? I get not being able to film real actors during the time of the pandemic, but what was stopping a bunch of IT and CGI pros from creating a bunch of episodes while sitting comfortably in front of their computer screens at home...truly beyond me.So here we are, still enjoyable to watch, but doesn't even begin to hold a candle to the first season. What a shame, such a missed opportunity.\n",
            "All the stories feel incomplete, even for a short story, generic, uninspired and generally lacking in substance. All in all, nothing unlike the first season. Cannot comprehend why someone did not notice this while the script was being written.\n",
            "Season 1 - 10/10 outstanding, dark, funny, full of ingenious twist and turns.Season 2 - lazy and generic.Was so excited to see a second season but it was a complete let down barring maybe two episodes.Hoping for a season 3 with the more input from season 1.\n",
            "Love, Death and Robots isn't for everyone. It's gratuitously violent, salacious to a fault, and not politically correct. And that's exactly what Hollywood needs to do more of. No, it doesn't need to make films that are violent, over-sexed or obscene (it's already doing that). It needs to stop making things 'for everybody.' LD&R is obviously going to offend or turn off some, but that's because it's not made for them. But for those who have been waiting for a true animated version of Heavy Metal Magazine, then this is for you. It's got cyberpunk, odd fiction, silly stories and all the sci-fi you could possibly want. What's more, each story is really well made (unlike some attempts to bring Heavy Metal to film). If you like short films, CG, sci-fi or Adult Swim, you're not going to want to miss Love, Death & Robots.\n",
            "Season one had multiple Episodes that where Masterpieces.Intruiging Ideas and Plot twists.I had to redo my review and adjust it down to 6 now with Season 2.That was a total let down, after the Hype when i saw the Trailer for Season 2.Boring Stories, and it felt incredible Short.Everyone has a different taste and thats good, otherwise the world would be pretty boring, but i only liked two Episodes of the Season.Not to mention that sometimes the Credits and Intro felt longer then the actual rest of the Episode!Everyone who likes short stories should check out the Channel \"DUST\" on Youtube.And maybe the writers and Producers of Season 2 should have get a little more Inspiration from there too ...Lets hope Season 3 will become better if twe ever get a third one....\n",
            "Alright. If you've just watched Volume 2 and think it's not too bad, but haven't watched Volume 1 recently. Seriously go back and watch Volume 1 now and you'll see how far short Volume 2 fell. I'm doing it now and seriously Volume 1 is on another level. Another level in every aspect. The stories are more fleshed out, more complete, the have resolutions also. The messages in each episode actually hold a deeper meaning and create introspection. The episodes feel like a complete work. The episodes aren't held back and are allowed to explore whatever the message may be. Volume 1 feels like unabashed cult classic and Volume 2 fees like watered down PC Hollywood. Volume 2 is also the exact opposite of all the attributes I described to Volume 1. Seriously Volume 1 was so good because of its unabashed direction for each episode. They didn't back down or give an inch and told their story. Volume 2 is like having the dial turned to 3 where are Volume 1 is like (spinal tap reference) the dial turned to 11.I guess Volume 2 cut out the heart of Love, Death & Robots to appeal to a wider audience perhaps. But it was so so underwhelming. I feel ripped off waiting 2 years for this garbage. Seriously 2 years. By the state of Volume 2 you would fee it was rushed to capitalize quickly on market demand. It wasn't rushed just ruined by the new direction it's taken by whoever was at the helm of Volume 2. Volume 2 is NOT Love, Death & Robots.\n",
            "No content\n",
            "Second season felt worse than the first, with only 3 enjoyable episodes out of 8 (well, the Snow one started well but felt unfinished, like it was just a teaser, but the last 2 were well-rounded and actually good in their own ways). The rest was just worthless dark&dystopian nonsense or comedy-horror nonsense animation. Have to take it down a notch from 8/10.S3: they brought it back to 5 good episodes out of 8, so 8/10 again from me.\n",
            "First season was so powerful. Zima Blue and When the yogurt took over are memorable works but season two not worth to watch so\n",
            "disappointing.\n",
            "So as I pointed out in my last review of the show, I thought season 1 was great, it was fresh, new, and gave us some of the most creative short animations we've seen. It actually had decent stories too and wasn't just art style galore.But the creativity and imagination died in season 2, and it was even obvious when they announced that it would only have 8 episodes as opposed to the first 18-episode season. And when season 2 came out, it was what I expected, eye candy with no substance.Season 1 had so many different stories with different and visually pleasing animations and they were engaging and fun to watch, and it was a new and different show.But season 2 was boring and not engaging at all, and season 3 is no different, but I still enjoyed it better than season 2.As I said, the only creativity left in the show after season 1 is just the creative mind and imagination of the animators and not the writers.These are for season 3 episodes:\n",
            "Episode 1 of this season is just the same old \"haha hoomans dumb\" and that's it. Can you tell show me where the creativity in that was? Did they show something new and told a new story other than \"dumb hoomans destroyed themselves?\" I'll give it a 5/10 but I think it's too generous.Episode 2 is an exception and why I liked this season more. It's directed by David Fincher, so how can it be bad? It had a good runtime and helped it become engaging, unlike the season 2 episodes. It had a great quality of animation, amazing voice acting by the lead, and good direction and cinematography all around. Someone mentioned that there was no twist at the end and the episode didn't have the surprise element, and it would've made the episode better. Which I kinda agree, the story was told straight with some minor twists, but I still enjoyed it and can watch a full season with just this story and this character alone. Solid 9/10 for me.Episode 3 is again all style and eye candy and no substance. There wasn't even a plot or a story there. 6/10Episode 4 was much more enjoyable, short and concise, and did its job of entertaining me. The only story that could've worked in this miniature style was Zombies and that's why I don't have a problem with them using a clichéd apocalypse story, as it worked with this style. 7/10.Episode 5 was decent too, but still was only style and action over substance and another story we've seen before. 6/10Episode 6. I didn't enjoy this episode much, the story was decent even though it was the same thing that's been done times and times again. Didn't really care for it other than the animation looked good. 6/10.Episode 7 had a cute animation style and the voice acting was good. The story was a little more creative than just your run-of-the-mill apocalypse story and felt Pixar-like.Episode 8 was whatever. They just mixed some military soldiers with some Lovecraftian monster and there was zero suspense and horror. The same spider swarm chasing we've seen in this show a morbilion times and even in previous episodes of this very season. They can do so much more with Lovecraftian horror and this is the best they can come up with? I thought there was no limits and boundaries to the imagination when it comes to making animations? 6/10.Episode 9 was nice too and I especially loved the claustrophobic cinematography it had, especially at the beginning. It still had a very simple plot with no dialogues, but I really enjoyed the art style and the cinematography was amazing, and the music at the end was great too. 8/10If I give season 1 an 8 (an 8.5 or 9 if we're being too generous), I give season 2 a 6 and season 3 a 7. They should've waited a year or two and just combined seasons 2 and 3 together so this way we could have something like season 1 where it had hit or misses but still was good. But since I only enjoyed maybe one or two episodes of season 2, I doubt it would've still compare to season 1.Like do you remember Zima Blue or The Witness from season 1? Remember that they had creativity in both animating AND storytelling?Now it's just the same world-ending story they themselves have done multiple times, with a new-looking alien or creature or robot and just a different animation style.Like did they use all their budget to hire those famous actors in episode 8 and didn't hire any writers?At the end of the day, these eye candies are just forgettable the moment you finish the whole season. Like I just finished the show the only ones I still remember and enjoyed, are the Fincher one, the rat one, the zombie one, and the last episode. What's the point of making these forgettable shorts again?If you're gonna do the same story over and over and over again with just a different art style, why not make a... I don't know, Multiverse episode or movie and just have a story told in different styles like that YT video \"Top 100 3D Renders from the Internet's Largest CG Challenge\"?Don't get me wrong, I love this show and I want it to go on forever, but do I really want to see another Robot/A. I/Animal uprising that destroys human civilization in season 4? No, no I don't.So please, for the next season, if there is one, please hire more creative writers too and make some of the episodes longer to be more engaging.Overall, I usually rate these anthology series based on the average of the ratings I gave to each episode. I remember after season 1 I gave it a 9 because it was really good, then the second came and made it an 8 for me, and now season made it a 7, although I adjusted my ratings for season 2 again. But overall, only like 4 episodes out of 9 episodes of this season were fun to watch, so a 7 for the whole season is more than generous.And based on all three seasons and their episodes, the whole show gets a 7 from me. I might enjoy some episodes, but since it's an anthology, you can't compare it to a regular show and ignore the weaker episodes and don't have them affect the rating of the whole show.If season 1 has stories that we've seen before, it can be forgiven as it is a new show and they're just warming up. If the season continues the trend of copying season 1, it still can be forgiven because it's their first time copying themselves, but if season 3 is the same thing again? When is the time to stop? And I'm totally not looking at you Westworld and Stranger Things!!!!Like, look at Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. Each season, at least after season 3, had a different story, style, and location. It took our protagonists to space, to an artificial world, to time travel for a whole season, and just gave us new things and put our characters in new places and kept it fresh. What did Stranger Things do? Only do the same plot over and over again for 3 seasons? Oh ok. And what about Westworld? The show that could've become one of the best shows of all time? Only turned its philosophical storytelling into a nonsensical futuristic A. I uprising in season 3 and no one talked about that show after it finished just like no one even remembers or talks about GOT.My point is, if you're gonna just keep doing the same story over and over, it might be better to finish your show than renew it for 6 seasons of repetitiveness. Remember when Netflix canceled The OA, one of the most creative shows, and kept budgeting trash movies with famous actors and renewing their favorite teenage show Stranger Things?I will watch this show to the day it stops making new episodes because I enjoy me some quality animation and art style, but I really really hope the next season will be better and more creative than this, but I won't hold my breath.\n",
            "Had I posted this after season 1 it would have been 10 stars, brilliantly innovative every episode made you think. Season 2 though 1 star, simply lacks the quality of story and twists in tail that made season 1 so brilliant.Season 3 better than 2 but still dismal in comparison to the first season.\n",
            "While I wouldn't stop pestering my friends to pick up and watch this anthology during the first season, I am extremely disappointed in the second season. Not a single story is worth remembering and is just a graphical showcase at best. Skip the second season like the plague!\n",
            "Less than 1/2 the previous season, not quite with the same peaks as a result. Cmon Netflix. Don't be cheap.\n",
            "Season 1 - Awesome\n",
            "Season 2 - AwfulStandard rule apply to all seasons of a successful series.. After success of season 1 makers often fail to create magic in subsequent seasons. Love, Death & Robots is no exception in this regard.\n",
            "Second season is a complete failure. I don't know what happened to the writers of the first season. This show had infinite possibilities to create any story on earth with any settings, but just lost it. The stories are complete, most of them open-ended, most of them just don't have anything in them. The concepts/setting are overused. You got MadMax/Star Wars with Snow, dystopian noir/blade runner with the baby killer, Wall-e went wrong with the grandma and her vacuum, but nothing original on this show. No conflicts, no resolutions, no unique concepts, just nice graphics and wasted 2 years of work.\n",
            "Okay so we havd season one with a few not great episodes but the rest awesome, and 18eps total for that oneBut then we get season 2 which honestly felt lacking anything compared to season 1 no good episodes for s2 just really felt rushed and on top of that less then half the episodes then s1 had which is even more disappointing!\n",
            "My only regret is that some of those episodes are not long enough and i would have love to see full blown movies out of them.Okey so truth be told i found out about love death and robots for a video on youtube that mention great science fiction animation series.I said to myself okay i will watch one episode and see how it is, i will be very honest the series is not all good, there are episodes lasting less than five minutes but other longer than 20 minutes. Some episodes are pretty bad too, but some are pretty amazing and would have made great long feature movies.All in all if you love sci fi its one great serie to add to your watch list.\n",
            "Season 1 is very very good. Nice concept, unique ideas, innovative,dark. S2 is really bad. No concept, no unique ideas( I have already seen the movie with the concept of the episode \"Tall Grass\"). Is this another GOT ? :)))\n",
            "So ill try to make it short as this season episodes areseason one had meanning and depth to every episode...it show cased a lot of touchy moments, that made u think and feel, think and fall.inlove.It was one if not the best tv show of its kind, only matched with black mirror who are doing the same idea without animationbut season 2 feels too much like an animation class graduates last projects....then a real series...\n",
            "the episodes are much shorter, no depth, no meanning...and yes they have some of the best animation ive seen ever...but other then that not much more... it really feels as if its an animation class projects...rather then meanngful lovely shorts like season 1...What a downfall fron a tv show that was amazing.\n",
            "Season 1 set the standard and season 2 fell short of that pretty hard.None of them seem to go anywhere or had any point. No unique story to tell. Except maybe the giant story but by then my interest was already lost in the season.\n",
            "I lowered my rating after seeing season 2 Because\n",
            "The new 8 episodes were not as shocking, spooky, violent nor as sexy as the first season was. And after an 18 episode first season... given they average only 9 minutes long this season, is a big disappointment. It's not even a full hour long... again it's good and my original rating was a 9 for season 1 but season 2 is much more benign.\n",
            "This was a great let down. I watched this season with my roommates just now and we had so much hype for this. Damn... A moment of silence......................................................\n",

            "LDR is an anthology show like Twilight Zone or Black Mirror or Outer Limits. There's a HEAVY sci-fi emphasis, just like in those shows, though LDR is quite heavily biased in favor of animated shorts. I feel like the first season did have a few live action episodes, but I might be misremembering.The animation can vary from cartoony, to 'uncanny valley' level photorealistic with rather alot of realistic caricatures in between. It's usually very good animation, but often there are lip-synching problems, motion problems, and other things that bring the experience down a notch...but still, quite good and in such a wide range of styles that the whole thing feels very experimental and boundary pushing. So I forgive all of that.What I'm less inclined to forgive is story. FAR too many of LDR's shorts come down to 'monster scary, monster hunt human, humans die with as much gore as we can fit on the screen'. Which...okay. That's fine. But do we really need so much of it? I haven't done a survey, but I will bet that between a third and half of the episodes fit into just random monster stories. Which is WAY more than is interesting.Further, part of the cool of a sci-fi anthology show is really exploring the ramifications of some weird concept or idea that couldn't support a whole movie, but can support one really thought-provoking episode of a TV show. And there ARE some of those in here. Just...not enough. This feels less like Twilight Zone or Black Mirror and more like American Horror Story where the arcs are single episodes instead of full seasons. I feel like just saying 'congratulations, you can animate blood and gore. Whoopdie doo. Can we actually insert some story or character too?'Honestly, most of the best episodes are front-loaded in the first season. I'm not saying ALL. But most. It's also the largest season.\n",
            "There are 2 or 3 episodes which I would say are good.\n",
            "However, the rest is predictable, too unrealistic.There is too much wanton sex and violence in some scenes. Just flashy, trying to seek attention.\n",
            "I don't care how good your animation is. I don't care how good your texture mapping is, or your pre rendered lighting, or your production design. Unless any of it supports a well written story, it's a glorified tech demo.And that's all this show is. It's a bunch of short \"films\" mimicking things the \"filmmakers\" have seen before without any concrete understanding of why it worked in the first place.The shorts are made by visual effects artists, not writers. The focus and effort was clearly on the animation WOW factor, and less delivering quality content, that people are paying for.I think the episode that finally broke the camels back for me was the episode in season 2 when the giant washes up on the beach:It looked gorgeous; the concept was completely original. THEN they have a TERRIBLE voice actor recite TERRIBLE, cliched, pretentious lines of dialogue that add NOTHING. Everything the narrator says can be SEEN on screen. Has this episode been dialogue-less, it would have been near perfect. But these films weren't made by story tellers, they were made by 3D effects artists. So none of them heard of the lesson they teach YEAR ONE in film school: show, don't tell. And on top of that, the dialogue is the most nonsensical lofty noise I have ever heard; a pretentious British voice actor reciting lines he doesn't understand, but they threw in a bunch of \"smart\" words, so that means the writing is intelligent, right?Really embarrassing. 2/10 because the animation is very good in all episodes, but none of the episodes themselves are good because the writing is poorer than poor. And I'm reviewing this as a SHOW, not a tech demo. Which is clearly is.2/10.\n",
            "No content\n",
            "Its odd to see such great storytelling in season 1 and a complete 180 in season 2. The lack of episodes in season 2 was a let down. Would i watch s3? Yea sure in hopes they recapture what they did in s1.\n",
            "It seems superlatives are needed to describe this anthology series, judging by the 10/10 reviews I'm seeing. Some call it a masterpiece, pure orgasm, a work of art, thought provoking, genius. I'll just call it \"not that great\".I did enjoy watching all of the episodes and I hope to see more of this series. With a runtime of around 10 minutes on average per episode, it's hard to get to the point where you'll actually start to really dislike it, because by then the episode is already over. Quite clever. The twists at the end are usually a letdown.A quick rundown of everything:1. Sonnie's Edge - 7,5/10. A decent story with at least a beginning, middle and ending. Good animation, somewhat clunky at times. A bit heavy on the misandry/feminism, which means a -1 from me.2. Three Robots - 5/10. Not much here besides some preaching. Too political and otherwise nothing special at all. Has been done better before.3. The Witness - 7/10. Great visuals. As a story, this wasn't too bad, but it's all about the ending. And once you know the ending, you realize the journey to the ending was entirely pointless. They tried to cover that up with a lot of nudity.4. Suits - 5/10. Not bad, but quite boring and nothing special. The little twist at the end is not nearly good enough enough to save it.5. Sucker of Souls - 5/10. Not much of a story here. It's like starting a mediocre movie half way towards the end, where you fall asleep again at some point and wake up just before the ending, which again isn't good enough to save it.6. When the Yogurt took over - 5/10. Why are we humans so self-destructive? This message again, in under 5 minutes, through a crazy metaphor.7. Beyond the Aquila Rift - 9/10. One of the better episodes, even when it's totally predictable. Great visuals, proper story.8. Good Hunting - 8/10. I actually liked this, although part of the message it wants to send across is a bit questionable.9. The Dump - 6/10. Visually entertaining and at 5 minutes in length there's not much more to it.10. Shape-Shifters - 8/10. Good and entertaining episode. The ending could have been better.11. Helping Hand - 8,5/10. Very good episode. Visually pleasing. Great little story to experience in under 10 minutes.12. Fish Night - 3/10. I don't even.13. Lucky 13 - 8,5/10. Proper story, simple but with a lot of action. Visually very pleasing.14. Zima Blue - 6/10. It tries to tell you something that you may find very interesting to think about. Or it's just pretentious. In terms of enjoyment, I didnt get much out of it.15. Blind Spot - 4/10. Decent enough to watch, but when the ending hits you after about 7 minutes, you realize you just wasted 7 minutes.16. Ice Age - 5/10. An interesting concept, but this has been done before, and it has been done before way, way better. The acting is totally cringeworthy, -1 for that.17. Alternate Histories - 4/10. Not very funny at all. Wasted opportunity, could have been a lot better.18. The Secret War - 8/10. This episode felt more like watching cutscenes of a computer game. Still decent overall, though, and worth watching.All in all, that comes down to a 6,5/10. Some good, some bad, nothing truly great.\n",
            "With few highs, mostly low and drag.. season 2 is not the sequel match to its predecessor. Animation or graphics are really the holding point otherwise storyline isn't as gripping as it was in every episode of first season.\n",
            "Season 1 of this show was extremely good. The stories had a lot of impact and had me anxiously awaiting season 2. Unfortunately the second season was a huge letdown in my book, seemingly just a few short stories with no real purpose behind them other than to be told.\n",
            "So I guess a good script is out of fashion. By the looks of it it seems to be inspired by Animatrix, both visually and auditorial, and if not for the horrible script, bad voice acting, the neverending one-liners, unnecessary nudity, it's predictable plots and the constant immature profanities, it could have been good. But it's not. It feels like it's been made by a bunch of teens who wants nothing more than to animate naked women and sex scenes.\n",
            "Every episode was mini and surprising. We don't know what is the episode is about in the beginning of each episode and there is no connection between previous or next episode. Good one😍\n",
            "I mean, it's just random episodes, but what's better? The surprise of not knowing what comes next. The thing in every episode is that if there's action or not, there's always a punchline to it.Not to even talk about CGI and Animation. It's beyond this world. It's the Youtube duration type of episode that makes you binge this. They could make this series run literally forever if they had the resources.\n",
            "The second season lacks the variety and beauty like the first season.\n",
            "Absolutely perfect. Nothing else to say. I wish every animated series or film today is created with this level of detail and style.Even kids shows creators could learn a thing or two from these people.I was just looking trough some negative reviews earlier and goddamn some people should just be banned from this site lol.\n",
            "While it is an anthology series, it doesn't need to feel like a collection of shorts that lack any substance. Instead, these brief clips rely on circumstantial twists to leave the viewer with an impression that won't survive repeated viewings. Its an \"adult\" animated series peppered with neadless language, nudity and violence that, ironically, will appeal to every 12 year old boy. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy all three quite a bit. I just know the difference between being entertained and being played.\n",

            "As stupendously good season one was, as hard is the fail in season two. Scientific inaccuracies, forced drama, bland Hollywood mainstream droppings from a bull. You people don't know how to write a captivating story again. You had it and you lost it. I am sad. Boo!\n",
            "Exceptional 1st Season, 2nd one a big disappointment!! No matter how you look at it.\n",
            "Season 1 had strong stories, every episode was so perfect and had true plots. It was really black mirror in cartoon. 9/10Season 2 wonderful graphics but too poor stories. Not even close season 1. Really desappointed. 3/10.\n",
            "I've watched a bunch of episodes, and I'm just not seeing what these high reviews are seeing. The stories range from boring to mildly interesting, and a lot are just plain confusing. They feel like B-roll Pixar shorts.Then there's the cursing and nudity. It would be interesting to see a show that doesn't go out of its way to avoid curses and full nudity, but this show takes it a step further, by just shoving the f-word and breasts everywhere it possibly can. It's almost like the animators were trying to distract from the lack of writing.\n",

            "A collection of animated short stories that provides various genres including science fiction, fantasy, horror , Crime and comedy. In order to comparing The first season and the second one , I should say The first season was beyond imagination but second one was not as good as first one . The Subjects are not related and you can watch the episodes not in a row .\n",

            "My guess is the raving reviews are written by teenage boys, it's the only explanation the ratings are so high. The creators are apparently teenage boys too, I mean it's hard to believe adult people actually produced this pile of drivel. It's badly written, incoherent, and basically just an excuse to squeeze in as many sex and violence as possible.\n",
            "Unbelievable what passes as \"art\" today.\n",
            "The first season was one of the most innovative anthologies I've ever seen, even though there were a few that didn't catch my taste. Season 2, by total contrast, was a big disappointment. Worst of all was \"Ice\", which has no story to speak of and, what's worse, wasn't even interesting from a visual standpoint. But the others weren't much better. The amount of violence and inhumanity was grotesque at some points. Overall the second season felt soulless and, no surprise, didn't feel as innovative as the first one.\n",
            "The first two episodes I really enjoyed, but it was pretty downhill from there. There were a couple other good ones, the werewolf one was pretty good. There certainly aren't as many robots as the title would suggest. Overall decent but could have been better.\n",
            "Sorry, but season two is pants compared to the first season.The stories are not as good, the endings fall flat, the constant smoking is just weird.The animation? It ranges from being incredible to being just a bit 'meh'.I watched it waiting for the two or three killer episodes that were going to save the season. They never came, the season ended and that was that.\n",
            "It sucks! Gone are the true PK Dick stories we all love, to be replaced by mindless stupidity- extremely disappointed!\n",
            "Just watch season 1, the 2nd season has maybe 2 episodes that are worth watching namely \"Snow\" and can't even remember the 2nd one.\n",
            "Season 1 was spectacular but I'm VERY disappointed with S2!! WTH happened?! Season 1 was everything I wanted in an speculative anthology sci-fi series, but S2 was half-assed thrown together stories that weren't even interesting, and at times down right awful. I just don't get it?!\n",
            "As someone else also wrote, season one was incredible. Short stories with amazing open ended stories left for your imagination. Out of the box concepts with great graphics.Second 2 was a bit disappointing both in terms of storyline and concepts. It feels like it was released just for revenue or repeat customers. There was no reason to release such a lame season 2.\n",
            "Not even close to season 1. Michael B Jordan episode is just dull.\n",
            "I want to echo the sentiment of a handful of reviewers here that this project gets respect for flash, but little for substance. By my episode 4 I had already come to the conclusion that this was just a modernized Heavy Metal, and then come to find out in the trivia section later that that's just exactly how this project was initially envisioned -- Heavy Metal 2.The problem is, in 1981, using animation to portray adult gore and sex was truly revolutionary. It was ground-breaking at a commercial scale, as only niche/basement shops were even trying it. But now you have to buy special software to keep that sort of content from literally falling out of the internet onto your screens. The plots are just as uber-simple and shallow, lean just as too far on gore and sex than is needed to tell a story, and any Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode can hold it's own to any of these stories concept wise.It's great to see what animation teams and studios can do without Avatar budgets, don't get me wrong -- I'm happy to see the art form get a spotlight. But the producers forgot what decade they were in.\n",
            "No content\n",
            "Binged all 3 seasons and gotta say, Bad Traveling (Season 3 ep 2) Was my favorite! \"At Times we Crack, only to Let the light IN!\"\n",
            "I also love the 3 Robots Exit Strategy. Jibaro was visually stunning, but confusing and I felt I was being slapped in the face with images a lot of the time which didn't make we enjoy it as much as I could have.Snow in the Desert and Automated Customer Service were a great watch. I already feel like that old woman and her dog (when it comes to tech lately) :O And All Through the House, was a creepy surprise so, those were may Favs of Season 2.Zima Blue, Lucky 13, The Dump, Good Hunting, Sonnies Edge and Suits as well as Three Robots were the best in Season 1. I love the Robots and the cat! Ha hahahaha Those poor robots would be terrified to step into my house. ;DOverall, a nice mix of different styles of animation and story telling, mixed with horror and sci-fi that made this a fun Binge!!;D.\n",
            "Everyone agrees that season 1 was an amazing exercise in animation. Also everyone knows it wasn't always about storytelling but then it was certainly about art, and vica versa. Some had done both, creating jaw dropping pearls like Zima Blue.However, like any piece of art comes into the world organically, this last season seems like an unrecognizable blurred copy of a copy where it feels like some self indulgent 80s producer walked in and said; \"Don't mind the plot! Add more gore! Lots of gore!! That's what edgy kids like these days!!\"Don't get me wrong, the animators did an outstanding job again because the visuals are great. But the plot really takes the last seat in the bus, except perhaps for the hilarious three robots and Mason's rats. But those feel like kind of easy rehashes of the originals.So in short, watch it with low expectations, absolutely don't compare them with the great first season and be warned: They contain scenes of senseless, extreme violence, even for the hardened.\n",
            "It's more or less a 7 but it deserves a 6 to set the record straight. The series in general is not bad but it has some very severe flaws.1. The animation is inconsistent and often annoying. For the first 2 or 3 episodes and 2 or 3 episodes after those it's incredible but it often devolves into extremely low frame rate or low effort.2. The stories in 80% of the cases are extremely primitive or undeveloped. Only in 2 or 3 episodes I felt they were complete stories. In most other cases they felt like undeveloped pitches.3. The characters are in most cases extremely uninteresting. Maybe the animation in most cases plays a role too.\n",
            "Season 1 was this Amazing thing that Netflix has given us and you could keep watching it over and over and not feel bored at all! The Plot the cinematic vision was simply so great! But then came season 2. Was so excited about it when it was announced and the expectations were so goddamn high that when i finally saw it was a a disappointment! Plot wise nothing interesting is going on - no base, no twist just plain bland! The visuals are rich and hyper realistic and only saving grace for season 2!Overall it's 10/10 for Season 1 and 2/10 for season 2.\n",
            "This show is amazing, it's the animated version of black mirror, you should definitely watch it but try to do it slow or you'll regret having watched all the chapters too fast!!\n",

            "Season 1 was something unique, then the series seemed run out of idea. Season 2 looked hollow and boring. Then, season 3 came out, only with more disappointments. The production team seems really like inserting their \"in-depth\" lectures and political views into the series, which would be fine if they are really highly educated. Then, there are episodes that solely focuses on disgusting audience with blood, bugs, and organs.It's really a shame watching this series declining to this level. Even with solid visual effects, the series is dead without solid stories.\n",
            "The anthology veers sharply between gratuitous semi porn violence as sexual metaphore to almost laugh out loud sillyness with a nod to philosophy in between. You can see the homage (almost rip off) storylines everywhere. Whilst I do like the style (mostly) this is effectively the visual equivalent of a smash and grab raid.\n",

            "At the time of reviewing, this show has had 3 seasons. Season 1 was an amazing introduction to an amazing show. It had 18 anthological episodes, and not one of them I'd consider to be bad. Actually, no episode in this show is bad, shockingly. Many people say season 2 was disappointment, but it was just an awkward introduction to the new season lengths. It got a very bad hand in general, even though a lot of the episodes it contained were great. But season 3, wow, what an amazing season. So many all time classics, it's insane. Please watch this show, you won't regret. The diversity of styles and stories alone should convince you to watch it, let alone episodes like \"Zima blue\", \"Pop squad\" and \"Bad travelling,\" which are amazing just on their own. 10/10.\n",
            "10 episodes shorter than the previous season, season 2's episodes feel like teasers, pilots or excerpts from a larger whole that you never get to see. Most feel incomplete and while some present interesting and thought-provoking settings, nothing ever gets properly developed. Apart from 2 or 3 episodes, all of them leave you unsatisfied with the small windows presented.\n",
            "Let's be honest, anyone who has read a bit of science fiction could guess the plot of most of the episodes less than 2 minutes in.You can also see it's been produced for Netflix, as the show really pushes the independent quirky dystopian character trope and the idea that everything men do is ruin (women's) lives and the environment (Sonnie's Edge, 3 Robots, Good Hunting, The Dump).\n",
            "That and some unnecessary sex/nudity that sometimes fell flat.On the subject of animation, there's good and there's bad.\n",
            "The art directions are nice, sometimes reminding me of Lastman, sometimes it's more like a computing power demo with huge spacial settings in an over-realistic modelling. But there's good diversity even if you sometimes see there's tracing in there (The Witness).\n",
            "Wandering features (wtf happened with Good Hunting?), big drops in framerate ... It can feel rushed.That being said, the show manages to take us for a tour of varied small universes that work fine for what they're trying to tell.\n",
            "The way it's been produced also helps, as we're given many different creative choices.Special mention to Zima Blue, my favourite episode as it's not trying hard for some impressive bs, it's perfect as a 5 minutes story. If the whole season had been just this episode I'd given the show a 9.Tldr : baby's first sci-fi, but short enough to be dynamic and not feel pointless.\n",
            "I can't imagine anyone over 16 watching the entire season and giving it more than a 6. No love (lot of sex though / Borderline porn). Death is here in form of carnage and mutilation. A few robots and a lot of already seen monsters. Should be called sex, carnage and a few robots. Very disappointed with the direction entertainment is going.\n",
            "As a reader of Philip K Dick and a fan of the Animatrix, I decided to give this a whirl solely on billboards alone. My only critique is that they didn't make enough of them. Can't wait for more! For those who like adult sci-fi and to suspend belief this is eye and ear candy.\n",
            "There are some truly great episodes in among these short stories, but there is also a lot of trash, and most of \"meh, but what the hell where they smoking\"\n",
            "I had decent expectations from season 2. The stories has no depth as such..Its superficial and the animation is not extraordinary..Rewatch the first season instead. Some stories are not even original even if it has 8 ep..\n",
            "I'm flummoxed by some people up in arms about the first episode pushing some kind of feminist agenda. Are they all part of the same loony men's rights group whining about the female Dr Who and the supposedly feminist Mad Max Fury Road? There is nothing here to empower women. Watching some of these episodes, I picture a bunch of nerdy guys circle-jerking over their collectively sick and misogynistic imaginations.\n",
            "There is some extravagant and amazing animation here, but it's overcome by really shit writing. By which I mostly mean dialogue. By which I mean noticeably bad and grimace-inducing. Written around some blatant recycling of previously original material. But it all looks 'WOW' and it's loud and so on and what not. And I'm still watching, even though I feel queasy. Like I said. I don't know how I feel about this. Perhaps I'll find something worthwhile as I keep watching...\n",
            "Season 2 was really disappointing, Stories did make me feel anything. A lot of them seemed like cliché Hollywood movies with bad endings. Why were there only 8 episodes, it looks like they weren't even try to tell stories as good and mind bending as season 1. I have never been let down more than this. When I saw the trailer I was pumped but wow Season 2 is TRASH.\n",
            "To be honest it is not that good. You can see these type animations everywhere. Stories play a big role here and some of them are good and others really bad.\n",
            "I discovered this Netflix original tv series a bit late. I only knew of its existence when I watched the promo for the second season on Netflix's YouTube channel.I could not put down the remote just like I did when I watched the first four seasons of Game of Thrones years ago. I binge watched both seasons in a weekend. Every individual story in this animated science fiction anthology could be made into a full 2 hour movie and I would gladly pay to watch all of them.The hyper-realism of many of the animations is out of this world. In some of the stories you really have to watch the facial expressions carefully to know this isn't live action, but animation. I got goosebumps with some of the stories. The stories are crazy good too. I honestly felt a lot of joy watching this series and I wish the makers of these short stories make full featured sci-fi films for the mature audience someday. Seriously, the kids have Disney and their subsidiaries companies like Pixar. But I would love this kind of hyper-realistic animation made for the adults with adult themes. I see the potential for the producers to make a lot of money. And because its animation, the creativity should be unlimited.I rarely give out 10/10, but this series deserves it. I was so hooked I was disappointed season 2 only had 8 episodes when season 1 spoiled me with 18.\n",
            "Story was too ambiguous and absurd.one or two episodes are good.Animation works are so beautiful but it's all wasted by poor script.\n",
            "There is no meaning behind most of stories. Just some lucky fancy guys in future who fight/run. Nay I'm not gonna watch again. Netflix need to keep up its quality, instead of landslides after the first season.\n",
            "Like every other netflix series you get good season 1 .. and bad season 2 .They try their hardest to make a good season 3, but they created Blood bath .. Wtf was that ... every scene you could see blood running over ... are you trying to prepare us for WW3 ?? A lot of unnecessary violence .\n",
            "No content\n",
            "Watched all the episodes in one go. The various types of animation used per episode is gorgious. Very creative short story's. Some episodes reminded me of the Deus Ex video games.\n",
            "This is a difficult review. I would rate some episodes higher than 7, but I would also rate some episodes lower than 5.The bad: The point here is that some episodes are extremely cliche. For example, the second episode is a cluster of cliches regarding women and it is really mediocre. Some episodes are meant to appear smart and critical of reality, but they don't do anything new. They re-use topics from other series and films (in a worse way) and embellish them with new animations.\n",
            "Finally, maybe the comical episodes are not for me, but I didn't find them entertaining at all. I skipped them because I found them cringy and corny. Thankfully there aren't many of them. But the comedy in such episodes is probably more appealing for kids (I'm not saying this in a derogatory way), it shouldn't be really entertaining for an adult.The good: some animations are good and others are very good. Some plots are good, some plots are very good. There are a couple of episodes that I really liked as they delivered an original and interesting plot and I found myself wanting to know more about what was happening. Some episodes manage to re-use topics that are already widely used nowadays (aliens, monsters and so on) but they manage to do so in an entertaining way.Overall, I would say it is definitely worth watching. But since each episode isn't related to the others, I would also say some episodes aren't worth watching.\n",
            "The good: Beyond the Aquila Rift. An absolutely amazing short that could easily be turned into a movie.The bad: First episode features cool fights and kind of edgy and stale story writing. Some episodes are so late teen to early 20 american youth culture that it comes off as cringe worthy at times. Did not spot any dabbing but was waiting for it.Some episodes are fantastic, but the show is not worth watching in it's entirety, instead seek out information about each episode and watch them individually. Personal taste counts for a lot in this show.\n",
            "Nothing less then fawking epic.. can I have 99 more seasons please?\n",
            "The second volume lacked every single aspect that the first brought to the table. Kinda disappointing. 8 episodes compared to the 18 that was the first season. Blood, love sex and head trips none existent in the second. Overall super sub par. I'll re watch the first volume.\n",
            "Second season totally 1 star each.2nd season was good only cgi tech as taste as video games cause by blur studio.finally this good production turned on wasting of time.\n",
            "Definetely worth to watch but it is not as good as first season.\n",
            "I got curious because of enthusiastic reviews, but was let down eventually. I must admit I only watched the first 6 episodes or so, and may be two others, during which I caught myself fast forwarding. I will not continue.There really was not a single bit of originality here. Every sci-fi and film noir fan will get the feeling of having seen every plot multiple times before. This also regards the atmosphere, which there is not much of in the first place, as there is too much action and most of the animation looks sterile, often akin to a video game. The only thing unique or new here might be the concept of an anthology.If I want violence, I can play a video game. If I want nudity, I can watch porn. Both is generally over-stimulating, but might be required for the digital generation to feel anything at all. A small dosage can contribute to the plot or to the atmosphere, but when it becomes a cause of its own it turns voyeuristic.And trying to be \"edgy\" means being a try-hard. It's just pretentious. An \"edge\" is nothing but a gimmick, a mask to hide the emptiness behind it. Always.I had some good laughs during \"Three Robots\", which is a bit calmer and more of a sketch. Three robots strive a post-apocalyptic city. Nevertheless, there still was too much of a moralistic vibe of \"humans destroy themselves\", which contradicts the incredibly humanoid nature the robots themselves show and which is heart of the story (heck, they're tourists). This left a bitter aftertaste.Another calmer episode, \"When the Yogurt Took Over\", was plain silly, not funny, just blatantly boring.\"Beyond the Aquila Rift\" was an alright attempt at creating an abyssal and nightmarish sci-fi vision, which I usually adore, but again I got this intense feeling of déjà vu here.You could rather spend your time watching some classic 80s and 90s sci-fi. Blade Runner, Akira, Alien, Neon Genesis Evangelion, ...I guess the genre is dead.\n",
            "Love, Death & Robots 2 is thematically and stylistically repetitive. Half of this much shorter season is animated in an ultra realistic style where the visuals mesh so well they could jump episodes easily. Given enough money to cover special effects you might as well have used living actors for all animation brought to the table. Even the ones that were more stylized brought nothing you hadn't already seen in Season 1. Now don't get me wrong, the animation standards were high, but you've seen it all before and many times at that.Thematically it is the same bag (with the only exceptions being \"The Tall Grass\", \"All Through the House\", and \"The Drowned Giant\"); dystopian future, heavy on future tech, resources scarce, Mankind's fault.Two stories are identical in which the house robot goes haywire and tries to kill the occupant. Two others have a man buck the oppressive system and pay for it.Otherwise, \"TTG\" featured an idiot idiot-ing into a danger telegraphed a mile away to the viewer. \"ATTH\" was kind of cute and although it's twist was also telegraphed it did leave you with a little to think about when it comes to expectations. \"TDG\" is straight out of the classic \"Gulliver's Travels\" story, Lilliputians and all but alas, this giant did not have luck on his side. Of all the episodes this provided the most food for thought, being on the nature of how an event goes from the facts, to society's and an individual's interpretation of those facts, and ultimately to legend and how little bearing that legend might have to the original event.It would have been hard to top Season 1 to be honest but this doesn't even come close. Season 1 was a 10; even the ones I didn't care for had interesting animation styles and stories that were not cliche. I have watched many of those several times but there are none in Season 2 I care to watch again. The overwhelmingly dark and depressing tone of 2 doesn't help either. This is such a disappointment.I am very disappointed.\n",
            "OMG ITS SO GOOOOOOD AND CRAZYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY JUST WATCH ITTTTTTTTT ITS THE BESSSSSSSST\n",
            "I think that this series of Netflix based on .. What If Secenario ...\n",
            "one thing for sure is ... I Want More .....\n",
            "Season 2 is not good. I've already watched 5 episodes and none are really interesting. The animation is better in Season 2, but the stories suck. When I watched Season 1, I kind of skipped past the first episode, and then I watched episode 2. OH BOY. The best mini episode I've ever seen and I even had chills at it's ending. WOW. But Season 2? I have no such feeling. Even Michael B Jordan's story was lame. I wish it was better. Like I said, the animation deserves an award, and the directing is actually pretty good. It's just the stories are BAD.\n",
            "Set aside the stories, this series has the best animation and different variations of it. The visual effects of some episodes is absolutely jaw dropping whereas some other episodes nah!!! Narratively weak.\n",

            "Especially Episode 2 and 4\n",
            "A somewhat cheesy and derivative animation anthology series which lacks a common thread.Each \"episode\" is standalone, and about 20 minutes long, so you can watch the whole thing in a single sitting.A big player of video games, and consumer of science fiction myself, on paper this seems right up my alley, but I found the stories to be a a little on the nose and lacking any gravitas or depth.There have been comparisons to the Animatrix, but this falls well short, as the Animatrix is a continuation of the philosophical questions and discussions that arise from the well thought out preceding IP The Matrix (1999).Not essential viewing, but a good time nevertheless.\n",
            "Some of the episodes were alright, but most of them feel like they finish midway. The series is an interesting idea, but I believe the episodes should have been more than 10 minutes long on average, so you could have some sort of character development.\n",
            "The show tries to pull off a vibe like the prequel and sequel to the 10 minute story are left to be interpreted by the viewer, but only a few episodes successfully accomplish this task in a decent and open-minded way.\n",
            "Sometimes I'll watch shows even if they're a bit out of my comfort zone if they're top notch. Figured with the reviews I'd give it a shot. I watched the first 2 and part of the 3rd episode and realized I'd seen as much as I needed and called it quits.\n",
            "The animation and plot concepts are a bit intriguing but I didn't feel it was close to redeeming enough to justify all the explicit content. These shorts aren't masterpieces\n",
            "Season 2 of Love, Death, and Robots just really sucks. I wonder how much money the tobacco companies poured into Netflix for so much product placement.In many of the episodes the animation is really good, but the story lines are really poor, and in virtually every episode cigarette placement is obvious.I wonder how people would react if this was a diet soda, oreos, or any other product. The near universal smoking in these episodes ruins the entire series.Some decent voice acting.Overall season 2 just nose dived into the toilet. Or should I say nose dived into the ashtray.\n",
            "This series is an absolute joy to watch.. but I have an issue with Shape Shifters. Why would you base a story on United States Marines and not try to be remotely accurate in how you portray them? Any Marine would correct the uniform and rank flaws for FREE because it annoys the hell out of us all to see these mistakes. And a Marine, would never refer to themselves or any other Marine, even the most garbage Marine, as \"soldier\".. the story and animation were great but I wanted to claw my own eyes out seeing the multitude of mistakes that google could've easily prevented..\n",
            "The animation is next level but the individual 'stories' lack narrative. While some of them are pretty straightforward you often feel like you're being dropped into the middle of a film just as the action begins, left to piece together whatever you can.\n",
            "There is no doubt that first season is almost perfect.The concept of the second season is very good. But it is too short and lacks storytelling. There are some hints of details that can make people guess the ending. (Except for the Christmas present episode)Some plots happen too deliberately( pop squad ). If it is a long story, there are many details before that, which will look more natural.I have to admit that short novels are actually too short. Sometimes it is not the fault of the production team.I have to say, the one who made the trailer video is the \"best\", because season 2 with all the short stories and misleading me to keep the expected as the same as the season 1\n",
            "Anyway, the quality of the effect is TOP1. Please don't miss this series.The independent animation market is too small, but it is still very exciting.Please, pls vote for it and let's keep it longer!\n",

            "I dont get what all the fuss is about, while the CGI is good (like all movies nowadays), this series is just social engineering. I watched the first 2 episodes and it was enough to put me off, the first was pushing LGBT/feminist garbage with cheap lesbian sex scenes, and the second was about 3 really dumb robots who were wandering the earth which was destroyed by global warming, im sorry, 'climate change', or whatever they are calling it now. All their dialogue was very weak and just cringe worthy. It would make more sense if they were from another planet, seeing how exceptionally stupid and ignorant they were.I think the problem is that there is nothing else on Netflix, hence this looks like a gem amid a sea of dreary programming. Anyone remember the Animatrix? It just feels like Love, Death and Robots is a big ripoff in terms of the styling, gore, sex and story telling. This programming really is for the netflix zombie hordes who dont know any better.\n",
            "But season 2 deserve at best 3 stars for the animation and sound design.. everything else is just a disappointing downgrade from season one.\n",
            "I loved the first season, it was a mix of great short films that drew you in, be it funny robots or over the top violence, it kept you hooked. Season one didn't have one episode that wasn't at worst decent.The second season, I can say the worst one of season one is 100x better than the best episode of season two, if there was even a good episode.Is like they hired gen z snow flakes to pick the episodes for season two ...skip season two at all costs.\n",
            "If you remember the 2012 anthology show, Metal Hurlant, that show did poorly what this show does well. Love, Death, and Robots has some relatively fun story ideas as long as you can tolerate a truckload of gratuitous violence, exploitative sexuality and writing generally aimed at delinquent minded male adults (or kids whose parents don't know or don't care what their kids are watching). It has a lot of similarities to the adult SF comic book magazine Heavy Metal, so a fair number of stories contain nude women on display, sexual humor, and when anybody gets killed in this show, which is about every five seconds, it is generally in a violently bloody fashion. Oh, and if you have ever wondered how many times a show can drop the \"F\" bomb, well get ready...Despite juvenile fixations, there are some cool concept ideas and themes, with solid action and good CG production. These are shorts though, so don't expect any developed depth. Each episode is like a snippet of an idea. But effective for what they are. Many episodes don't have time to do anything more than carry themselves more on gratuity and visual creativity than real plot, but they successfully hook you in with decent premises, and then ride out an extended scene of the initial idea. For the comic book shop crowd, this is sure to be a winner. Ok, so there are some episodes that are quite creative and/or humorous, with occasional Twilight Zone or Star Trek type of twists, and these are usually the most fulfilling episodes, but that only happens here and there. Three minutes into most of these stories and you pretty much know what you are getting, but this isn't necessarily bad. I would put most episodes on the same level as a typical video game level premise with added adult content. So... sort of a dumbed down Black Mirror with a superficial video game-ish spin, directed toward the \"we never grew up\" generation of nerd-core adults.\n",
            "This show has lots of variety, every episode tells an interesting story some episodes are better then others but still I was intrigued my every episode, some ppl on here hated it but there's more ppl that liked this show then ppl that hated it so\n",

            "'Love, Death & Robots' is, unfortunately, rather disappointing. The premise for this animated anthology series is a rather good one, allowing for a variety of creative adult-aimed animations, which is somewhat of a rarity. However, the delivery is far from perfect. The biggest issue here is the writing. While each individual short has clearly been animated by different groups of people, allowing for a huge variety of styles that individualise them, most of the short stories have been adapted by the same person. This means that despite the visual differences, the writing issues are carried over throughout the entire series. Firstly, the dialogue is mostly unconvincing and this really makes it hard to care about the characters, which obviously limits investment. Another issue with the writing is that most episodes have the same structure, which makes things more predictable as the series progresses. It doesn't help that this structure isn't all that great to begin with. The shorts aren't constructed as if they are short films (which, at the end of the day, they are), but rather as if they are long-form stories (whether that be full series, or in some cases feature films) condensed to a very short time. Of course, this makes them feel very rushed which limits investment even further. It also doesn't help that most of them are based around some sort of twist or reveal. Most of the time, this just comes out of nowhere and feels like something tacked-on to garner shocks, rather than a natural part of the narrative (there are a few standouts to this, however, such as 'The Witness'). This is perhaps down to the actual writing rather than the story, though. The narratives also often end really abruptly and unsatisfyingly, which leaves a negative lasting impression of the shorts. It seems as though they realised that they only had a short amount of time and decided to just end the episode at the point in which that ran out. Another issue with the series as a whole is, despite it purporting to be an 'adult' show, it is actually very childish. It's as if it has been devised by a group of thirteen year-old boys with a fresh insight on swearing and the female anatomy, making the majority of bad language and nudity just come across as gratuitous and unnecessary. Most of the more mature aspects rarely add to the stories and that's a shame because if used appropriately, they could have created a more adult tone that allowed for a deeper exploration of certain themes. Unfortunately though, they just make the majority of shorts feel immature and crass. It's also very sexist as a whole, unnecessarily objectifying women on several occasions, which can be rather uncomfortable. The show isn't completely bad, though. In fact there are a few episodes that, for the most part, avoid the aforementioned issues (such as 'Three Robots' and 'Zima Blue') and others that are interesting enough to get past some of the bigger issues. Another highlight is, of course, the animation. Each episode has a unique visual style and, for the most part, this really elevates the stories and makes them more enjoyable as you can see the care and attention given to that side of things. It's just a shame that the writing doesn't live up to this. Overall, 'Love, Death & Robots' is definitely disappointing on the whole due to its many issues, although the quality of the shorts does fluctuate and there are definitely some good episodes here. A lot of them are worth a look purely for the animation, too. It's decent, but doesn't live up to its full potential, especially with some of the big names attached to it. 6/10\n",
            "Season 2 has been netflixfied, its PC stilted and cautious, if you expecting to be shocked then you would be better of watching a today, this is very bad...\n",
            "I loved season one but thought I'd write a positive review as I also enjoyed season 2. The only disappointment for me was it felt too short! I was getting into it and then there were no more:( I'm glad I gave it ago before reading the reviews.\n",
            "Season one is what happens when you give resources to talented people and let them do their thing. Amazing through and through.Season two on the other hand is what happens when you mute the same people and make them work for half the wage. There is only 1 story that stands out and this season is mot even as half as long as the last one. Why Netflix would let this is beyond me, as the first season was an immense success story.It's worth watching, the animations are amazing nonetheless, it's just a shame that Netflix lets such good shows rot while churning out digested dog food.\n",
            "Season 1 was unique. I must say season 2 was a disappointment for me.\n",
            "Presaumably a bunch of 13 years olds watched a load of black mirror episodes and decided, \"we can do that, but let's animate it instead so we can go really over the top with it so hopefully nobody will notice there is zero substance to it\".First episode is actually not too terrible but the series goes steeply downhill after that. Be prepared for a lot of \"and then he woke up & realised it was all a dream,\" type endings, with plenty of clichés & terrible dialogue filling in the gaps.Maybe some kind of Tom Hanks \"Big\" scenario actually happened in real life & the person in charge of commissioning at Netflix was actually a 13 year old in an adult's body at the time this got signed up?\n",

            "Fantastic CG animation with a variety of art styles on display, from very realistic to highly stylized. Some interesting stories and characters, though a few episodes also had me yawning. Season 1 might've been my favorite if only because they apparently either hired some more feminists or listened to their mindless criticism and decided to remove any appeal to the dreaded \"male gaze\" in the subsequent seasons. Unfortunate since season 1 had a number of beautiful female characters, while seasons 2 and 3 are completely lacking. Overall a decent show.\n",
            "Season one is great and season two is almost all garbage.\n",
            "\"A collection of sci fi animated shorts mostly pertaining something to do with love, death, or robots. As someone who tends to gravitate towards preferring the longer, slower series format over that of films, shorts are an art at yet the further end of that spectrum. To have only 10 - 15 minutes to set up, build, and walk through a narrative is extremely difficult and I believe is why we tend to see shorts in the realm of \"\"people at the bus stop\"\" stories, since the setting is common ground and let's us immediately dive into the intricacies of the story, the sparkles that make it shine. All of this is to say that when we move to the sci-fi setting 15 minute shorts end up taking the large portion of their time in the \"\"set-up\"\" phase, with the payoff being a cool blip 30 seconds from the end. LD&R often plays exactly into this, leaving me with a \"\"oh okay I guess\"\" sort of feeling after many shorts ended. A few of the plots / twists were cool, but even less than a week later, few are memorable. If you're a fan of animation alone then this series should be definitely on your list, it has all the goodies: cel, motion capture, 3d, and my favourite rotoscoping, but as sci fi narratives its a little flat.Volume 3 of this animated sci-fi shorts anthology was just released so wanted to check it out. Like those before there are some of these that shine, others that aren't so great. Each is relatively quick, all generally shorter than 20 minutes. As consistent as those volumes before in quality, from this series episodes Night of the Mini Dead and the finale Jibaro were my personal favourites. If you like animation, definitely would recommend.\"\n",
            "This is my first review of a movie/series ever.Maybe I'm not a fan of this genre, but I didn't quite catch the plot of most of the episodes, when I did - it was so dumb... otherwise there seemed like no plot and they tried to hide it with nudity, monsters/aliens and other weird stuff with no logic whatsoever which I wish I wouldn't watch.Although the yogurt episode seemed fun.I wouldn't recommend to watch this \"amazing\" series at all, better go watch something good from real life or save your time to enjoy other stuff.e7After watching this I'm feeling confused and shocked. There is no benefit in watching this, no inspiration, no mood boost, not a single good and useful thought to get from this series.1 for the graphics, typography, intros, animations. Those are great. Enjoyed.\n",

            "I really like Love, Death & Robots but it's not perfect show, it has its flaws.The animation is always incredible, I just wish they put more effort into the stories; it's like the stories are just there to keep it chugging along while it gives you an \"animationgasm\".It's a beautiful series from a visual point of view, but the episodes lack the substance they need for it to feel like a really satisfactory watch. A lot of the episodes just end abruptly and leave me feeling underwhelmed despite the amazing art work.A lot of the episodes in Volume 3 are very gore-orientated, which gets a bit tiresome after a while. I don't mind a bit of gore, but there's only so many times I can see someone getting ripped apart, guts flying everywhere and heads being crunched into oblivion before I get bored. The first series is the best for me because there was a lot more variety about it, still, the other two series have got a couple of good episodes as well.It's a good show overall - different, creative, and much more alluring than most crap out there these days. I just wish they'd work on the storytelling and (like the first volume) weave in a few more light, upbeat episodes so you've got a more rounded anchor of genres instead of 80% carnage and bloodshed.\n",
            "Netflix doesn't stop surprising. After massive failure of classic animation adaptations, they finally got something damn right.Let me start with saying, that overall quality is all over the place. It seems that there aren't many common elements. Quite few shorts just don't keep up with the tempo that was imposed by first five episodes. Clearly there was little to none communication between studios as many stories don't have much to do with anthology's title.If we were to judge book by it's cover it would be solid 9/10. Absolutely stunning variety of styles gives a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Unfortunately, only few decided to go beyond looks and serve us narration that is equally engaging. Majority looks like impressive tech demo, especially ones using motion capture.It is a bit disappointing, that instead of love, death and robots we get more of immature nudity and primitive exposure as a common theme. Although, there are fragments that use it as a part of world-building and that can leave quite an impression (vide The Witness, season 1, episode 3).Whole anthology is quite a mess in regards to what it's trying to convey. First few animations seem to resonate towards \"Black Mirror\" or \"The Animatrix\" in the best way possible. Further down though it feels like going to posh, underground restaurant. Entering with a promise of wild, crunchy dishes served in complete darkness we realise soon enough, that said meals are half cooked broccoli.Regardless how anthology feels as a whole, first few episodes deserve an ovation. And when you finally take a sit after applause you might as well watch till the end. Because even though emotions disappear seconds after fade out, during viewing itself it's easy to convince oneself, that veganism is highest form of cooking and broccoli can actually be quite a feast.\n",
            "Yep. Sometimes I have to log in, come here to the comments, and put in my two bits JUST because... a show or movie made me cry. This is one of those times.And even when a particular episode doesn't tug at those particular heartstrings, it winds up tugging at some others. And there's just not enough of that in popular media products, these days.Netflix is picking up the old narrative gantlets that traditional media money is now leaving to (otherwise) shrivel up and die on the ground. Good on 'em.\n",
            "Gratuitous overuse of the f-word... If it needs to be used once or twice to establish the makers' bona fides, so be it... By the way, it's not only this show, it's seems as if almost every show or movie... Trying to figure out what it proves... Who's being marketed to...I'm no prude... I like The Big Lebowski, speaking of overuse of the f-word...I've overused the word myself on occasion... Just getting tired of hearing it...Also occasional gratuitous use of violence and nudity.. I guess I could change the channel, but some of the episodes are otherwise interesting enough to ignore my complaints, qualms.Each episode also needs a much stronger appropriate-age viewing notice... The little notice up in the corner for about a second is not enough... Needs a large notification that takes up the full screen and lasts for 2 to 3 seconds... And specifies what elements got the show its rating: So it is clear that this show-though animated-is for an older audience.Otherwise interesting technical work.. Most episodes seemed to have a difficult time finding a satisfactory conclusion.\n",
            "The majority of these shorts are both predictable and needlessly edgy. The amount of cringe-worthy cursing and pointless nudity is crazy.Save yourself some time and watch the good shorts: Lucky 13, Zima Blue, Good Hunting, and When the Yogurt Took Over.Honestly I have no clue how some of these were even written. It's a shame that such a good genre was dumbed down to the most simplistic and one dimensional shorts ever created.\n",
            "Una buena serie, las reproducciones deberían ser constantes.\n",
            "This show has the gravitas of Black Mirror in the sense of it being a completely new level of quality for Netflix. I am so used to being disappointed by the torrent of subpar shows on the streaming service.HOWEVER, along comes this strange show a friend and I decided to try because the episodes were small and we needed to watch something offline for a drive. Well, we were exchanging looks very soon, \"Is this really that good?\"I was utterly floored by some of these episodes with their weighty themes condensed into ten minutes. I had to check many times to even be sure the episode was merely that short.!If you happen to not like a certain episode, give another a shot. This show is so beautiful. The artwork is surreal! But most importantly--- it's actually interesting and written very well!!!It's funny because I don't usually say this, but--- you wont be disappointed!!\n",
            "There are many extremely entertaining episodes. Definitely the opposite of typical shows. You never know what you're going to get. Good for watching alone, but I decided to write a review after watching a particularly terrible episode.The storyline I just last watched was trash and it seemed like it was an excuse for an artist to be as gory as possible at the expense of everything else. I ended up fast-forwarding through even after increasing the play speed.I only gave 6/10 stars because many episodes are unsharable based on graphic content. Even if the story and originality is great, not being able to share it destroys the biggest enjoyment for me personally.\n",
            "I very much enjoyed this anthology of (mostly) animated short stories, though I don't recall seeing any actual \"love\" in any of the episodes. There was a lot of sex and nudity, which I get is essential to some of the plot lines. Though I would indeed like to see more content like this on Netflix, there seemed to be an unnecessary number of schlongs appearing in some of these episodes. I get the importance of nudity in some of the scenes, but excess is a turn off when I'm trying to engage with understanding a character and \"oh, look, it's another dick\". :(I also enjoyed the mix in animation types, though I must admit that the stories that interested me the most were primarily CGI (\"Sonnie's Edge\", \"Beyond the Aquila Rift\", \"Lucky 13\" and \"The Secret War\"). This could be because they were the most intriguing stories, or that they were some of the longer ones, or because I am just use to this style as cutscenes for video games. Either way, I would be interested in seeing full length features of each of these.The stories that seemed intriguing in concept but the weakest in this anthology in my opinion were \"The Witness\", \"The Dump\" and \"Zima Blue\", though each had their own \"a-ha\" moments.All-in-all, though, I would be willing to put up with a few stinkers in order to see some quality shorts in another round or two of anthologies like this. Bring on \"Sex, Death, Robots & Monsters\" part 2.\n",
            "This is a review of Season 2 (I don't remember S1). Some of these stories are really well done but they feel very short. This is like watching 5 min episodes of the Twilight Zone or similar show.There was more than one story where when it finished I was like WTF? What was that? What was the point? It was like watching a bunch of trailers one after the other, interesting, fast and leaving you wanting so you want to tune in and watch what the trailer introduced you to. But there is no more.I remember really liking Season 1, but after this one I am not sure I would recommend it, although I did find it entertaining for what it was.\n",
            "Well that's a couple hours I'll never get back. I guess I'm alone here, but seriously, people liked this? Aside from 1 or 2 mediocre episodes, it was a complete snoozefest. Yes, it's visually beautiful, but that's all this show has going for it. It's mostly either tired, played out stories, done a million times before, or complete random nonsense. It's just not worth the time at all.\n",
            "The 1st episode just blowed my brain and i was yelling what😮!! The!!!?? By the end of the episode.\n",

            "Yet again, the zeitgeist of this generation takes another big nose dive; but it isn't so apparent to most I'd imagine because the aesthetic is so pleasing to the senses. Indeed, volume II definitely continues raising the bar in terms of artistic expression. But it falls well below the mark when it comes to character and plot development. Before I saw it, I tried to moderate my expectations realizing the situation was a little like having intercourse for the first time and even that did not prepare me for the drop in quality. Indeed, volume I had a much larger budget obviously and was probably only ever intended to be a one-off. Its catalog included: fantastic elements of horror; the occult; post humanity; same-sex relationships; uplifted animals; sentient robots; transhumanism; cyborgs; aspects of virtual reality; telepathic aliens; and even couple of mechs.The question shouldn't be: Was the second iteration of Love, Death, + Robots as good as the first; but rather, does it carry the torch forward? And the answer is a resounding, yes. In this collection, the stories were shorter, but tended to be centrally focused around the core topics of death and robots. My absolute favorite three were: Pop Squad, Ice, and Snow in the Desert.\n",
            "2 years for season 2 and this is what we got? 8 short episodes full of cr*p.Dont bother with seas.3.\n",
            "Everything.about this show is great if your willing to suspend your disbelief (yes, I'm looking at you \"Helping Hand\"). My only problem with the show is that it tries too much to reach a wow-effect by cramming in plot twists in practically every episode.Sometimes this succeeds, sometimes it worsens the episode. The \"plot twist\" at the end of fish night really wasn't necessary. It could've just been a beautiful spectacle, with an almost meditative effect. Yet they force in this terrible ending to make the viewer go \"oh no I didn't expect that\". This episode didn't need that. It could've done with a calm and beautiful ending, and it would've made much more of a continuing impression to me.Overall, this anthology is absolutely fantastic and I'd recommend anyone to watch it.\n",

I really enjoyed a number of the episodes from season 1, particularly Sonnie's Edge, The Witness, and Good Hunting! But season 2 I felt was a major let down both for the fact they cut the episode count by half, and also I really only enjoyed one of the episodes they did put out. I have let my subscription go for the past six months or so because the quality control they have on series like this has slipped and I have lost interest. A total shame, I really think that adult animation is a very untapped market- I really would like more shows of this style rather than the Rick & Morty or American Dad types.\n",
            "Loved season 1 and was so looking forward to season 2. After watching season 2 in like 40 minutes, I would have to say I'm highly disappointed. Only 8 episodes with only maybe 3 decent shorts. Feels like a big let down (like GOT's last season). Have a big build up and it just falls flat.\n",
            "My cliche is that this is the first time I have felt compelled to review. That took me by as much surprise as this original work of art on Netflix. It's not for everyone, but what is, life has become homogenised enough. The sheer volume of repetitive durge that is spued out as so called 'entertainment' today makes it difficult to find genuinely original and mentally challenging works but this series of shorts hits the nail clearly on the head.\n",

I love anthologies, sci fi, and animation; this checks all those boxes. There really isn't even a bad episode out of 18, all under 20 mins I believe; but there are at least 2-3 stelllar short films in here.

Please Netflix, take note of this overwhelmingly positive reaction. Make and buy rights to more of this kinda stuff, PLEASE!All that being said, there is def some NWO Technocratic conditioning and predictive programming going on here, just be aware of that, develop and maintain a sense of symbolic literacy, and it's less likely to permeate into our un/sub-conscious......Edit/update: second season is absolutely abysmal maybe 1 decent episode out of 8....\n",

Some of them had very good animation going on, others not so much. They ALL had terrible writing, dialogue and voice acting in common however.If adults came up with this, then they are NOT masters of their craft. They either don't have a talent for writing, or they need to get a lot more life experience under their belt before they should be given a platform like this to show off their work.Every show I watched was loaded with extremely predictable scenes and plots, VERY bad dialogue, and very frequent clichés. Most of them tried very hard to be artistic, but it all felt so forced. As such, it failed to deliver any real entertainment value to me.Most people are giving this pile of garbage a ten star rating... TEN STARS!! Y'all realize that means this is one of THE BEST THINGS YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE! That's like saying sesame seeds are the greatest snack you've ever had.

Season 2, however, offers only half the stories, and nothing with the same power of earlier episodes such as \"Zima Blue\". There are flashes of talent, but nothing that really pushes the boat out for me.Season 2's best episodes are \"Pop Squad\", \"Snow in the Desert\" and \"The Drowned Giant\"; all great starting blocks, but don't do enough with their 15 minutes of screen time. The animation in the first two is second to none out there, and this technical proficiency is what actually makes the series stand out.Unfortunately, the weaker episodes are borderline wastes of time. \"Ice\" and \"Automated Customer Support\" are just animation flexes, lacking any substantial plot or personal inspiration. This is exacerbated by the lack of episodes: only 8 after two years of production? This is a confusing downgrade from Netflix, particularly since some studios must be clamouring for the opportunity to produce this sort of work.\"Love, Death and Robots\" is a project I am a firm advocate of: it fills a market gap that sorely needs indie flare, whilst giving them the budget to flex their talent. Having said this, the poor showing from season 2 does irk me, and makes it hard to really justify the experiment continuing too much longer.\n",

Quite a shame as that first season was one of the best, most surprising things to come about in years. Solid prediction here. No Emmy wins this time...no nominations. Guaranteed. What a vanilla let down.\n",
            "First off, pretty much every episode shows the utmost epitome of 3D rendering and animation. And therefore is a must watch for people fascinated by CGI and animation.But what lacks is story and depth. Expected though when each episode has a runtime of about 15 minutes and the fact that every episode is an entirely different story. The problem with this is that you never really get past just watching it for the visuals, knowing the story will end with a somewhat predictable twist or event. I hope season 2 extends their episodes to 30 minutes, and really go beyond just visual spectacle.Season 2 update:\n",
            "Letdown of a season with a increase of quantity at the cost of quality.Season 3 update:\n",
            "Back to why most of us loved the show when it came out. Fantastic CGI and neat little short films. Though there is a big focus on gore this season and after a while it becomes uninteresting. Also this season lacked storytelling. Most of it was just way too simple. Jibaro, the final episode, wins with it's insane creative expression, the directing style is chaotic but so, so visually enthralling. Noticeably from the same studio as season one ''The Witness'' and you can tell instantly. I do think the directing was better fitted there than in Jibaro.\n",
            "Some of the best animation and artwork I have seen in this show. However, the show is too clearly written by men for men, and beyond me is why men love to watch women being raped/tortured or having a past as such, stories of revenge and some male saving the poor girl.\n",
            "I really don't enjoy watching it and it ruins everything.\n",
            "Um 1st ep wasnt that bad, i enjoyed it. But there are a couple of episodes like Fish Night which i would rate -1 if imdb premitted something like thay. There are a couple extraordinary episodes either with some twist or the message it sends to audience. But there are some episodes that are so lousy and pointless that I as agnostic, i thank the god that ep doesnt last long. Ok animation was really well done and music, sound effects were brillian.. Ill give it 8. But i feel like it deserves 7.\n",
            "After now watching the second season of Love, Death & Robots, I can say I feel similarly underwhelmed. Every episode of this show has beautiful animation and style (although I prefer the stylized episodes much more than the one aiming for a photorealistic look), but stories in this show either offer very little or, because of the episode runtime of about 10 to 15 minutes, have little time to explore these stories effectively (\"\"Pop squad\" from season 2 could have really used more time to flesh out it's world\").I begin every episode of this show with a \"My God, this is gorgeous\" and end it with a \"Wait, this is it?\"\n",

            "Well anything would be better than S2. The only good episode was the pirate one that fincher actually directed. Everything else was some liberal agenda or lacking some semblance of an ending to the story (season 1 did this masterfully). The last episode was absolutely horrid. It felt like a struggling indie director with no budget filming guerilla style.\n",
            "The first season I would rate as a near 10/10 but the second season just wasn't as good and the third season was just a nothing season... maybe it'll get better... until then, 6/10 and that feels generous.\n",
            "The animations in this show are beautiful. Really, it's top notch. As far as the storytelling is concerned, there it fails. It tries to be cyber-punky, it tries to be horror and it even tries to be funny, but it falls short of all of those goals. If there is any societal commentary in there, I don't even want to know what it is.That being said: I just saw the first four episodes and decided to quit watching. The first one was silly. It was dark for darkness' sake. As if a fourteen year old wanted to come up with a video game and hatched a blandly violent one while throwing in a blandly flat extract of Lisbeth Salander in there. Yuck.The second one was just flat. It wasn't funny enough to be funny, it was a bit trite, and the twist device at the end was ham-fisted at best. I can't even come up with more than two lines about that one.This leads to the third one. Similar story outline: stuff happens, we throw in some nudity and violence and the twist at the end is a deus ex machina that doesn't explain the circular story at all.The fourth episode is a typical American piece of mythology where hardworking white folks are colonizing the wild west, surrounded by savages that need killing. It features a completely senseless amount of violence against an indigenous species with no backstory whatsoever. It's more stupid than Starship Troopers was, and that's saying a lot.To cut a long story short, this is what you get when you take science fiction, strip it of its philosophical inquiries, boil it down to a 15 minute sound bite and dumb it down to serve adolescents.The two stars? Well, they sure can render breasts and gore very well. I'd steer clear of this mess and go and watch some Star Trek, Doctor Who or Orville, really.If you just want to see animated nudity, there's a whole genre out there that does that better too.\n",

No need to take me to your leader, then. You're IT. It's not for everyone. It's an anthology show, gloomy, black comedy, dystopian, violent. It's no light in the end, as you would expect from David Fincher. AND not all episodes will be your cup o'tea. I adored the start with the 3 bots, with cats the new rulers of a destroyed mankind. And I loathed the cagematch between the... somethings. That's what a show like this brings. You will NOT like everything. Just like Black Mirror. That's why I give it 7/10. Because you'll need some perspective. And btw, I don't even like animation. But seeing that episode with the ship who travelled... way too far. I was dumbfounded. The characters was so real, only my eyes finally saw something that told me that yes, this is animated. But bloody hell, they did a good job.\n",
            "Holy jesus would of gave it a ten if every other episode wasn't about how woman are equal and or better than woman lmao\n",
            "Sorry. Nope. Not wow. I had hoped to enjoy these little clips.After the 3rd one I wanted more. MORE DEPTH. More Character Development. Any kind of development.Like eating a bunch of desserts. Sparky and nice but not really fulfilling.For myself, this Form leaves a lot to be desired. It is a failure. Oh well.\n",
            "I had to edit my review.I gave Love, Death & Robots a 10/10 based on the first 7 Episodes, which are really good.But right after \"Beyond the Aquila Gates\" (E07) the quality drops dramatically with plots being boring or utterly obsolete. Even the CGI you are presented with is less impressive and outstanding. But if what you are presented with is just mindless action without any character development, no emotional attachment to any character, no plot, no visual WOW-effect, then there is nothing left but a boring exercise in CGI, that I am willing to acknowledge, but with a disinterested nod. You can throw a mindless masterpiece of wild action, devoid of any depth at me once or twice, but if that's all you have I'm out.I'd rate Episodes 7 to 16 with a 4/10 leaving the whole collection of shorts with a 7/10.\n",
            "I am not sure if it was PC or the fact that it got popular and the executives thought they would make it mainstream for profit but this season ruined the show for me, and I will not be looking forward to the next season in the same way.\n",
            "Definitely something different. Episodes 1,2,3 and 7 my best so far. Some episodes tho are really lacking and almost seem to have no point and nothing like the ones mentioned. Now if they created a series based on Episode 1,2,3,7.... DAMN!Season 2, about 3 episodes worth keeping.Season 3, vfx was good but WTH was up with the stories this time? A complete let down! MOTto keeping a single episode👎😐\n",
            "This is maybe the top of CGI tech, but the most of the episodes are not memorable. The stories are quite repetitive, I have seen tons of sex and nudity, heard tons of f words, and seen blood more than love,death and robots, honestly put in the stories often without a reason. A missed masterpiece,what a pity. I preferred the underrated Oat Studios, much more story in that.\n",
            "I'm sick of people comparing this to Black Mirror. They are nothing alike. Most episodes in \"Love, Death & Robots\" are just sci-fi themed randomness. There's no deeper meaning to any of the episodes, no thought-provoking questioning of the morality of tech. And that would be fine, but people who've never watched Black Mirror keep comparing the two, and it's annoying. Please don't be that guy.\n",

            "Created an account to leave this review. I skipped over this show a few times because I'm not into animation type movies, until I came here and read the reviews. Glad I watched it because I was hooked from the first episode and wish there was 20 more. It has a real Black Mirror vibe mixed with the Matrix, Interstellar, and Kill Bill to it. Each episode stands on its own and isn't related to another, so you can start anywhere; but you'll being desperately wanting more. Even though these are short films, the amount of detail and story isn't lacking. The animation is also superb, hitting almost every style; from hyper realism, to anime, to Disney-esq. The brilliance is the story telling and what's truly mind blowing. Definitely worth watching more than once.\n",
            "Basically what this is is an anthology of animated shorts for a mature audience. Think Heavy Metal, Liquid Television or The Animatrix. That sounds like a cool idea, but not all the shorts are very good. Some are animated in that hyper-realistic video game cutscene Robert Zemeckis style, which I really don't understand. What's the point of it being animated if you're going to make it look as realistic as possible? Why not just make it live-action? A lot of these shorts are pretty much just big long action scenes, nothing really too original or interesting. There's also the mature content, which goes too far sometimes. Some of these shorts would play out exactly the same if you took out the sex, gore and swearing, it just isn't always necessary and comes off as try-hard and childish. However, with all that said, some of these shorts are absolutely beautiful with breathtaking animation, creative concepts and inspired imagery. This is stuff I love in animated shorts, and Love, Death and Robots definitely delivers on that, just not all the time. If you like animated short anthologies all done in different styles and genres, LDR is worth a watch. It's not that great as a whole, but it has some really great stuff in it.\n",
            "Unnecessary gore, profanity and nudity. While some episodes like the Hitler one are kind of interesting they don't save the overall downright bad quality of the show. Too bad all these different animation artstyles are put to waste. What exactly is the point of hyper realistic cgi animation again?\n",
            "Jaw dropping animation quality. Give it 5 more years and we're out of the uncanny valley folks. The amount of micro facial expressions at display and actually hitting home here is insane.\n",
            "The overall art style used throughout certain shorts really raises the bar and is going to be hard to top. 10/10As for the writing, sure it's got its share of anti-climaxes, a particular \"pay off\"-form that's not gonna please everybody. And a deeper message was not always present, other than 'Yo Look at all this \"Love, Death and/or Robots!\"'. A simple concept used to engage us into a wild rollercoaster ride of emotions and visuals. 8/10With influences from anime, games and typical shock value that fuels our social- media-induced-and-short-attention-spanned-society these days, this series is a perfect example of a \"fine product of its time\". 9/10 from me\n",

            "Love, Death, and Robots (S02, 8 eps, 10+ mins, Netflix) returns for a significantly shortened - thanks Covid19 - season. My review doesn't really vary from season one's. The story's are too short, much like a scene or two from a larger film or what used to be called \"pilot\" episodes of proposed new series. In any case, the focus of effort/budget for each is the animation which is mostly photo realistic with extraordinary detail evident at times. Concentrate on this instead of the very short stories and you'll be much more satisfied.*** Season 1 *** LD&R (S01, 18 eps, 10+ mins, Netflix) is an anthology of 18 short (10-15min) mostly animated episodes. Please pardon me for not reviewing each of them separately. However, they're all top notch quality, not a dog in the bunch. Much of the animation that's done is photo-realistic - amazing. Only one episode \"Ice Age\" uses live actors mixed with SFX. Most if not all of these could be launching points for films or series, since they were so short; they seemed more like a scene from a larger effort. Do note however that several of the episodes are not suitable for younger ones, but for us adults, they're a real treat.\n",
            "I respect the work behind the episodes, so many people involved and the artistic result is at most cases perfect. Some of the episodes are quite amusing and thought provoking but the story of most of them is really sick for my taste and quite disturbing.Nevertheless, I am sure I will watch the next season when it comes out, I am just too curious.\n",
            "I was really excited to see this show on Netflix as the premise seemed to echo along the lines of black mirror or the animatrix.Unfortunately, this show is none of those things. The stories are vapid and \"edgy\" with random nude women and \"fucks\" thrown in for no reason except to realise the seemingly 12 year old writer's wet dream.We barely it though 3 episodes in the hopes things would change, but it didn't. Don't waste your time on this, It's sad that they didn't pair the brilliant animators with some at least barely decent writers.\n",

            "The Tall grass episode is a lot like the Stephen King and Joe Hill short story and Netflix video. Not only are the names the same but some of the creepy things that happened are really close. But yet no mention that I could see of where this material came from. Makes me wonder.\n",
            "Some of the stories were complete and fantastic. Some left you wanting to know why they were made.I thought nudity was unnecessarily present. The audience could have been vastly expanded and more encapsulated with the plot if there was less casual nudity.\n",
            "While the animations is quite lovely, most of the stories, with the exception of Lucky 13 and Alternate history, are tired takes on ideas that have been done many, many times before. If one is going to grab an idea and re-do it, at least add some originality. And at least have an ending, not just roll to a jarring stop. If there's a second season, do a little better in the writing.\n",

            "My only concern is that it has nothing to do on Netflix, we know how it works, and it is all about money. I don't know how they chose the studios and if they had total creative freedom or not. Also, it would have liked a bit more \"love\" films (except if showing boobs means \"love\" to them).\n",

A lot of raw talent there, at first I thought they picked some animations from there or at least those who has made content for that channel.I sadly noticed that S2 is that short :( What a bummer.But there is potential, surely. Had a lot going on in season1.\n",
            "Finally got some time to watch the season. Overall it is fun to watch most of the episodes with gorgeous animation and story twists. I would love to see episode 7,8 and 18 turn into a full movie. On the other hand episode 13's story is so lacking that I tried to fast forward although it is only 13 minutes.\n",
            "I love the animation format and really wanted this to be black mirror but better. Unfortunately that's not the case, only a few episodes took advantage of the medium, and I think there was a lot more that could have been done with the animation style.The stories are generally fine, one or two were interesting but mostly they're covering well-treaded ground. It's still worth watching and I enjoyed it, but I feel like there's a lot of lost potential.\n",
            "Some of the digital graphics in this series are outstanding, incredible examples of the future of graphics and technology. That's why it gets 3 stars.However, as for the stories themselves, that's all it mostly is, a tech demo. The stories are all mostly paper thin, like the rough outline of the beginning of a screenplay, and the worst part? Almost no completion to the stories as presented. Also, as a side note, often times the brief amount of time I spent with each character, I found them to be overwhelmingly annoying.How much fun does it sound to watch the beginning of 26 films, with almost no resolution? That's this series.Oh, and the \"love\" part of this series is mostly just gratuitous digital nudity that adds nothing to the stories, that could have been time better spent telling an actual story that has a beginning and (most importantly) ending.\n",
            "Undeniably dazzling craftwork to feast your eyes on. Each episode is stunning to look at and worth the watch. However, many pieces are let down by derivative stories and characters from the male perspective.Quickly got bored of weapons, monsters, and cheesy bros. It became painfully disappointing to be let down when clearly each one was such a visual work of art. Made it hard to put a number on the ratings.18 episodes and only 1 with female directors on the team. Come on.. you can do better through the selection process and wider narratives.Highlights for me:1. Three Robots (love its stupidity)\n",
            "2. The Witness (outstanding technical styling and motion)\n",

            "An absolute DISAPPOINTMENTThere's only one episode (#4 Snow in the Desert) that came close to S1's quality. #3 Pop Squad was also good but took a bit long to get to the point.All the other episodes were just weak and thrown together👎The producers or even the individual creators of some of the S1 episodes should really look into creating sequels, if not a series bc they were mind blowing and I still rematch them with my daughters every now and thenLet's hope they take their time for s3.\n",
            "Sex, violence or robots would have been a more suitable title, everything else (story, plot, characters) is just added to fill that up. A teenager movie, not much else to see. I rated 6 for the graphics, three episodes were enough.\n",

            "The first season was just lit. One the most unique and successful animated series with a ( TV-MA) rating. I was eagerly.And .oh my God! What the hell was that? It's stories are so dumb, that we tend to think if we are dumb or the writers are dumb. The animation was great. It looks like they tried dip the stories in a tenet script and ended up a mess.\n",
            "I enjoyed less of the shorts than I had hoped but not so few that I feel this was a waste of time. Especially since the episodes themselves were so short.Speaking of which, so many of these stories could have been greatly improved if they had more time to flesh out their concepts and characters. As they are, there is often not enough time to get invested and to really feel the impact of what the writers want you to feel.I enjoyed the different and unique styles of animation, except for the hyper realistic animation used across multiple episodes. Only Sonnie's Edge used it well by still being heavily stylised and having some interesting lighting. The others all looked like video game cutscenes in the worst way. It didn't help that most of those episodes had some of the weakest stories as well.So, most of these stories include nudity and swearing to some extent because this is not for kids. Honestly, it didn't bother me all that much, except in a few episodes where it definitely felt forced. Did we really need a topless protester in the yogurt episode? Kudos to them for keeping the male to female nudity ratio pretty even by my count.With the series title of LOVE DEATH + ROBOTS, you would expect at least one, if not all of those things in every episode, but some episodes' attachment to those themes are a bit of a stretch. Hopefully season 2 is a bit more thematically focused.Overall, I like that this show exists as a vehicle for animators to get their foot in the door and experiment a bit, even if that means that not every episode is going to land successfully.\n",
            "A series of unrelated episodes. Without a development from the beginning of a story as a background setting, they're just drop you to some point in the story and finishing it up usually with half closure. Sometimes with satisfying progress or sometimes ending closure. Anyway these are each in the category of short film. Some are interesting and some were just midling. It's like they ripped an interesting part of a full film, but only the interesting part -- according to the writers.I wonder if these were written for people with short attention span. Anyway most of the animations graphic are of good quality.\n",
            "Was very excited for this new series, but right off the bat, the very first episode was immediately one for the garbage can. It's not just that the cringe-inducing cliched characters are straight out of a 10 year old's imagination---wannabe toughs replete with vile temperaments and non-existent personalities---but the swift and enthusiastic embracing of the \"men are toxic\" and SJW class-warfare tropes are both prime examples of coming from simpletons, serving only to intentionally insult the majority audience (sorry, not sorry, snowflakes) such a series depends on for its very existence. I don't need yet another thinly disguised rant on imaginary societal ills.\n",
            "The animation is good. Some stories are OK but most are very predictable and cliche, which is a real shame given the cash and talent thrown at other departments -clearly male writers and 'storytellers' who haven't really grown up. The comparisons to Black Mirror are weird and lazy, and likely from people who think pseudo-anime nudity and often pointless violence makes something gritty and interesting. Not bad, but a bit of a waste of an opportunity.\n",
            "I suffered through each episode hoping something would redeem this show, I think I would have preferred being waterboarded. Half-assed pointless stories with little meaning. Feels like they were written by a 10 year old.\n",
            "The show over all was fantastic. Each episode was amazing, some better than others. The worst thing about the show was the audio. In one scene its so quiet you have to turn your audio up and than during an action scene it gets extremely loud.\n",
            "I love one episode having no correlation to next allowing for so much creativity. Using different animation from episode to episode to match the tone of the story is awesome. The length of the episodes isn't a problem either but I went through the show in one sitting. If the episodes are so short they could've made a few more or simply added a little more character building in some episodes. Regardless I love watching and look forward to more.\n",
            "It's not a singular show so much as it is a collection of shows with no cohesion amongst eachother. I wouldn't be surprised if this thing was just a marketing gimmick to test what audiences were interested in the most for future potential productions. However the quality, wildly different artstyles, and vastly different story topics means that it's not necessarily a show to binge-watch because it could be a little jarring from one episode to the next. I don't think I want the second season to continue any existing stories but instead have it's own batch of new ones.I will give a warning about a particular episode though, because apparently the order of the episodes might actually be random or in a different order for different people. Personally speaking, \"Sonnie's Edge\" is probably the most disappointing thing I've ever watched because it has so much potential that gets thoroughly wasted.It had everything going for it and could have been a pilot for a whole new series. One of the most interesting settings and concepts I've seen in a long while and in a particular style with great animation that fits it perfectly. Immediately pulled into the world and wanted to see more of it unfold... but then oh dear god. It literally feels like it was written by an over-active Twitter user who failed Highschool English Class. Every single facet of the writing is below bottom-tier and it decides to double-down when it has the chance to recover. My disappointment was immeasurable, and my day was ruined.\n",
            "As with all anthologies, the episodes are hit and miss. Mostly, the graphics are enthralling. Some of the stories are entertaining, and some are gross, as in \"what were they thinking?\"The producers needed to find competent audio mixers. Some of the episodes have dialog at 20 dbm while the special effects are at 90 dbm. Clearly, this does not make a pleasant viewing experience.The anthology is heavy on swarms of creatures. After three volumes, the swarm episodes got a little tired.I am surpised that \"Zima Blue\" is rated so highly. I found it to be an extremely boring paean to black supremacy. Probably the most gross is \"The Drowned Giant.\"\n",
            "Season 1 had mostly good episodes. Lot of interesting stories, originality, and different animation styles. Season 2 was just garbage. Almost every episode was just a flashy cgi tech demo of how realistic looking they could make their characters. The stories were stale and cliche. The characters are forgettable and the dialogue is just cringe. Having just watched Castlevania season 4 probably set the quality bar way to high. Just watch that instead!\n",

            "I had previously given a 10 to this show when i had watched the first season. I was amazed by the animation, the story, the direction... and so much more. Had to try really hard to find a flaw.On the contrary, Season 2 did not live up to the expectations at all. Utterly disappointed with the rush in ending a story, loose plots and shawdy work that looks like it has been done in haste. The only few episodes worth watching would be as follows:1. POP SQUAD\n",
            "2. LIFE HUTCH\n",
            "3. THE DROWNING OF THE GIANTI came to IMDB to give a rating of 6 or something for the second season, but i realised that would over shadow the amazing work that they had created in the first. So just taking away 1 point.Season One set expectations REALLY HIGH!!!!!!\n",
            "The first thing to note is that much like the previous season, this one felt a bit too short. While the first season had sixteen episodes, this season only had nine. Since the episodes' running time ranges anywhere from six to twenty minutes, watching Season 3 can sadly feel like a fleeting experience if you were binging it. It is still long enough to scratch the itch that a year's hiatus left by the last season, but leaves the viewer wanting more.However, what Season 3 lacks in quantity, it more than makes up in quality. With a couple of exceptions - Night of the Mini Dead is literally a zombie movie on fast forward - the season is absolutely fantastic. Whether it is a welcome return to the show's original season in Three Robots: Exit Strategies or a weapon of mass destruction with the personality of a puppy in the episode Kill Team Kill, fans of the show will undoubtedly find something to enjoy.\n",
            "I really enjoyed most of season 1. They always packed lots into the short episode duration. Zima blue, good hunting, the witness, Aquila rift and the yoghurt one I've re watched loads of times.I didn't find one good episode in season 2, they all all seemed to have no real ending, like they'd just finish out of nowhere and I was always disappointed. Definitely not going to be rewatching them.\n",
            "Uniqe stories perfect pictures i cant describe this i just open my mouth shoking by the incridble show\n",
            "Other than the first episode the remaining are all very similar in style of animation, and without much humor, fright, charisma, or heart. Did not really vibe with any of the characters or the stories, again other than the first episode. Unlike the fantastic season 1, all of which I re-watched more than once, Season 2 will not get as much as a second glance.\n",
            "It's like bringing on Dust and CGI shorts on YouTube, but much more polished in terms of the animation and the story snippets. For the movie about the refrigerator, I can't even distinguish the characters from live action. The story snippets are exactly that -- a situation, and as much about the character that can be portrayed in that time. Many of the shorts don't have a complete story per se, but that was not its intent. There is no chacracter building, but then again, that is not the purpose of these shorts. They are skits, and as such, very well done.\n",
            "I like the animations in all episodes either the 2d or the 3d, but there are lots of episodes that I feel they have no beginning, no end, no plot twist, nothing, not that much effort in terms of writing. Just a fight with a mythical creature(s) that doesn't end well or a dream in a fantasy world, which is still visually captivating but nothing else.Some of the episodes are just \"ideas\" from short scenes from very well known movies, like \"gravity\" or \"world war z\" or \"wolverine\".Very small number of episodes that i really liked as \"good hunting\" or \"mason's rats\".I would say the animation and the production are very well done. The writing is not.Also the amount of violence, gore and sex is too much, and the warning on netflix at the beginning of the episode says \"+18 violence\" but doesn't contain anything related to sex or nudity, which seems misleading for me.\n",
            "Movies should be art, not political propaganda. 15 mins into the first episode and I saw everything - man bashing, lesbian action, fight the power... The only thing missing was \"Orange man bad!\" line.\n",
            "The first trailer showed crazy animations. It has 2D, 3D, motion captured animations in each episode. What I didn't know that each episode has their own genres in different stories. I stopped watching it because, personally, it certain nudity in various animations gave me an eyesore.\n",
            "If you want to see here actual review, just skip it and keep scrolling for another one. There is another special case I want to talk about. People I know divided in their opinios oppositely, some consider this series as great, some as awfull. No grayscale here, only black and white. Trully unique case, social phenomenon.\n",
            "I had many recommendations to this series from my friends. So, I asked my best friend did he already watched it. He replied positively and added: \"It's one of the worst things\". I've got to explain here. My friend likes almost everything, many movies he likes for me are the mess, he is not that categorical as I am, so if HE tell about something it is bad then there is really something wrong about it. Eventually I became so intrigued to watch it by myself (actually I thought if he don't like it, for sure I will).\n",
            "So quick overall. Every single episode have that futile story, that feeling I am watching not a professional product but some kind of amateurish work like school project of nine year olds never leaved me. It was really hard for me to get to the last episode. Don't know why I accomplished this task, is it was a curosity or a hope next episode will be at least something worthy two stars or more, but all in vain. Everything is objectively bad. Even technically there is nothing special: cartoon episodes offers nothing fresh or interesting technique, 3d episodes graphically outdated - just look for Warcraft III's (which is more than 15 year old already) movie clips for example.\n",
            "Tim Miller's LD+R is an instant favorite. An anthology of (mostly) animated short R (MA) rated films no more than about 16 minutes in length.The short format means there's almost no time for plot or character building. Miller tends to focus either on one intense event, or a montage of shorter events to paint a broader portrait of the world or a specific character. He also holds nothing back in the departments of gritty dialog, over the top gore, and overt sexuality. He does away with just about every nicety we were taught as children so if that's not your thing then look elsewhere.Each episode introduces a new fantastic world so perfectly portrayed that I find myself wishing many of them would break out into their own series. The artists who brought Miller's stories to life are like magicians.Netflix hits another home run. Go watch this one (ones) right now! The episodes are not linked in any way, they do not share the same universe and there is no tying plot, so pick any episode and enjoy!\n",
            "I watched the first 3 episodes. The initial reaction was the animation. Highly detailed and you can see the effort that went into every shot.There wasn't much of a story any interesting characters. Im sure that they could have made it better because animation is expensive. Spend some of that on writers.I don't understand why other reviews give it a 10. Maybe those users have never seen a good movie or maybe they actively avoid engaging their brain.\n",
            "The first season had mostly good episodes. Second season had a few. Third season was downright consistently weak. Like unwatchable. And the last episode cemented that. What happened?\n",
            "Season 2 is total disaster. Period.Hmm, my \"review\" is too short, obviously.Just like the shortest review ever - yes, that one written by Bernard Shaw while ago...Frankly, season 2 doesn't deserve the effort to write review about it.\n",
            "I literally watched my own male organ go inside my body at not one but several parts of this series. Holy Cow. This ish is tubicular and radical all rolled into one and then smoked by a cowabunga!\n",
            "There are maybe 2 episodes that are decent. The rest of the episodes gave shallow stories and are littered with overt sexual themes and violence. Their favorite is sexual violence towards straight white males. Stereotypes are everywhere in the series and the message is clear: Straight White Men are the devil and should be brutalized.\n",
            "The biggest let down is how over hyped this is, it set my expectations high. This is just Eat Carpet from the 90's and 00's re runs we've all seen before, except for our generation. But unlike Eat Carpet it's skewed because Netflix writes for Netflix first, for entertainment last. They have to check off all the Netflix approved talking points and try and shoehorn entertainment somewhere in the end of it all which leads to failure almost always.\n",

            "The last few days I was way too busy to watch Netflix so I was very happy when I opened Netflix today and saw that the first season I available. I watched the whole season in one go and I regret nothing.The nudity:\n",
            "To me it feels like the makers here had to hold back all nudity and sexual content they wanted to show in the past and tried to compensate for all that int this series.\n",
            "Well, in \"The witness\" even I thought that it was a little much, but whatever.\n",
            "I saw some reviews of people that seemed disgusted by the nudity, but I think those people don't even look at their own naked body in the mirror. If you have a problem with (female) breasts and nipples, you should stay with the 99% of shows and films where you don't see those. Otherwise, this is a show for adults anyway.The gore:\n",
            "Some episodes are very brutal. Because of this, I would only recommend this series for people who can stomach that and it's definitely nothing to show to children.The stories:\n",
            "It is hard to classify, having all these very unique episodes. Some episodes are really something to think about, others are more .. simple.\n",
            "The first episode for example has no sophisticated story, but has great visuals and sound. The second one is more simple and and funny, while the third one does seem to try to surprise the watcher, but even a very easy distracted guy like me could see the ending within the first minute, even though there was almost at least one pair of shaking breasts every ten seconds throughout the whole episode. In my opinion the episode \"Zima Blue\" had the best story.The visuals:\n",
            "Some of the episodes (1: \"Sonnie's Edge\", 7: \"Beyond The Aquila Rift\", 10: \"Shape-Shifters\", 11: \"Helping Hand\", 13: \"Lucky 13\" and 18: \"The Secret War\") had extremely great animation quality. Most of the other episodes had nice art styles, too. Those very well animated episodes just fit my personal taste the best and you could see the great amount of work that has been put into it. I would love to see a complete series based on one or more of those episodes.Overall:\n",
            "This series is great for people like me, who watched TV series as a child and who now would like to see more grownup content, without the limitations that are placed to reach a wider audience. It's surely not for everybody, but I'm pretty sure that there is a very big audience who would love to see more of this and the reviews I'm reading here are telling me the same.\n",
            "Love, Death, Philosophy, Biochemistry and Mechanics. This is a series which, I will never want it to finish. I'm actually very sad that I reached the final episode. I was watching with all my senses, laterally. I even played-back some scenes on work to just figure out if I'm understand right or not. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. PLEASE GIVE US MORE SEASONS.\n",

It is that much great. Every episode contains its own story. And a episode is only 10-12 minutes (sometimes higher and sometimes lesser). You can think it is like a collection of short movies.\n",
            "An anthology sci-fi, of sorts, should be refreshing and welcome news in this era of the fetishised serialisation of anything that moves but this show kinda nose dives after the opening few episodes of season one. The animation is variable, sometimes very basic and the stories often don't have any sort of payoff. There's a non sequitur feeling to proceedings despite the heightened drama although I did enjoy the recurring vacationing droids. Mostly the stories have the sci-fi archetypes and a sci-fi feel but without sci-fi stories to go with them. I feel these would do the job for film school course work but quite why the show got so much attention is another baffler from the streaming age.\n",
            "Was looking so forward to season two. Horrible letdown. No real storyline, mediocre animation. Seemed like they just rushed to make up things. Skip this season and hope if there is another one it's infinitely better.\n",

            "So far so good it's right up my street very similar feel to the old animatrix series that came out many years ago. Each episode is different and the different genres and animation styles are superb but my only gripe is the unnecessary nudity in a few of the episodes. Especially when it serves no plot purpose. Without the nudity it's a straight 10/10\n",
            "I cannot believe this has an 8.5 rating on here this show is complete trash. It tries so hard to be quirky and \"out there\" but it fails and comes off as stale and stupid. Everything in this show I've seen before. The dime a dozen sci fi dystopia, the big fighting robots, the post apocalypse we've seen a million times etc. The Yogurt episode is a rip off of the movie The Stuff. It's like somebody took all the rejected Black Mirror scripts tore them up and rearranged them to come up with these episodes.Just because a show is animated does not make it good. This show is trendy, boring, predictable and uninspired. I watched season one and I can promise you I will not be watching one nanosecond of season two.\n",

            "Doom and gloom, pretentious in your face liberal propaganda are littered everywhere in this sci-fi horror fantasy series. It does not bother about the nuance of both arguments made by pro-2nd amendment advocates, climate change 'deniers' skeptics, and support for strong US borders. The show already decided that not only are these people wrong but they are fools, idiots, and morons that will be solely responsible for destroying the planet and their demise is comedic.There is nothing really new here. The visuals and animation are great but storywise something that has not already been done in previous sci-fi like Heavy Metal, HP Lovecraft, and various shows like the Twilight Zone, the Outer Limits and various syndicated sci-fi horror programs from the 80s.\n",

            "I must say i am an avid Netflix viewer. And i enjoy alot of there shows. I stumbled upon love death + robots randomly. Right off the bat i was hooked! The first episode made me want more of the story to only go to the next episode and find out that they are all there own different story's. I was in shock at how great the graphics were and how well the story lines were and that i havent heard anything about it yet.5 min into the first episode i realized they were going to go hard core extremely graphic killing and yes even extreme nudity! The 3rd episode (i believe) there was a women dancing naked and you pretty much see everything, and i mean down there everything.It was just great tho to see the way they told the story using these methods and ahowing thw kind of worlds these people lived in.It was very Animatrix meets japanimation if you have seen any of those. Along with the story linea and story telling of black mirror. Thats the beat description i can give. Its a perfect mix of all those things.\n",
            "One thing I noticed as I went through this series, if the episode has a soft core porn scene in it then it gets rated 2 points higher than it should. Overall the series is OK, some very few episodes are really good, but the strange mix of \"here's a comedy, here's a porn, here's a mind bender\" just doesn't seem to work any better than randomly googling \"short videos\" and putting youtube on autoplay.\n",
            "And then its followed up by a second season which demonstrates how stupid, tasteless, and derivative the decision makers are. There are artists out there who can tell a story but they are stymied by the in-group of self serving connected people. Emperor has no clothes, but unlimited funds to rip off other titles.\n",
            "Most episode of season 3 is very good. But I truly love S3E7 the most..it was cute at the end... But what I want to know is will there by continuation for S3E6 cause it seem to be hanging? Or that the end or it..without any closure...\n",
            "I tried my best to watch all the short episodes back to back in one set as they were short (< 20 minutes/each) but still I couldn't as the ideas presented are scattered and alot of them were not new to me. From all the 18 episodes I watched from season 1, only fewer than 6 episodes were intellectually smart scripted (beside the eye catching visuals) and lot of sci-fi fans would appreciate them.. the rest were fun to watch but they were not interesting that much.The episodes were like a playlist with the title \"Love, Death & Robots\" of short movies that are different in content but they fall in the titled category.The episodes do not hold back on violence, gore, and nudity.. which make me feel that episodes are not concentrating on the ideas but on \"showing\" what they think the audience want to see.. A lot of episodes I thought of skipping but I didn't just to give a fair chance for the review.\n",
            "Nice visuals and art, but everything else is just unbearable, do not watch if you are over the age of 18 or have a decent attention spam, is waay too edgy, and believes it is much more clever than it actually is\n",

            "I started with \"Three Robots\" and thought it was cute and interesting. So I ventured further in. The deeper I got into other episodes, the more disappointed I became, and soon stopped trying. Even the episodes that got the best reviews like \"Good Hunting\" were a turn off, leaving me feeling worse for having seen it. Most of the stories were unimaginative predictable tropes of a psycopath acting with no motivation other than being cruel, and artificially created revenge situations. Many of the stories were overly gory and predictable; I saw no point to, or redeeming quality in, most of them. Frankly, I am sad that \"Love, Death and Robots\" got such great reviews, not sure what that means.\n",
            "Lots of these are interesting/action packed, not all of them are great, especially the comedy ones... if you plan to look for comedy the best one is three robots, being the most visually appealing along with good humor. the main problem is all of these have twists, which some of these are predictable such as mirror's edge(although that wasn't a bad short) and some of these make you feel like they deserve a spin off series which i believe was what Netflix was planning to do if they weren't all concluded, shooting a few ideas in the dark and see if they hit seems logical, if not they do have a season 2 in plan so maybe the following episodes would be transitioned there, all of the shorts are animated differently and feel different from each other(besides its dark nature)\n",
            "What use are the show's gorgeous animations when it's so badly written that twenty minutes in (episode and a 1/4) I had traumatically experienced everything from cheesy edginess, failed attempts at humor, and overall, an overwhelming sense of \"trying too hard\".\n",
            "If the rest of the series is anything like the first two episode and I'm almost certain it is, since these impressions indicate something fundamentally wrong with the series direction, then it's a solid 2/10 (for graphics and animations).\n",
            "After an incredible season one, it appears that the producers of LD+R. Caved in to the harsh criticism that there was-- too much female nudity-- in the initial season. So provocative stories in seasons two and three were clearly sanitized to appease the critics rather than appeasing the taste of the audience that loved the first season so much!So it now appears that the writers, directors, and producers of the animated series attempted to compensate for the reduction in eroticism and graphic nudity by increasing the amount of profanity and graphic violence. And it really didn't work, IMO.I initially rated the series as a nine. But now I rate it at 8.Its still a good series with some provocative and interesting stories. But subsequent seasons will never be as good as the first season if the series continues to appease the political anti-sex league (Orwell's 1984).\n",

            "That pretty much sums up my experience with LD+R.I managed to watch the entire 3 hour run time of this incredible new series in a single sitting, and some of the episodes I even watched twice.While visually amazing with promises of intriguing storylines, much of the writing was rather lacklustre to be honest and as a sci-fi reader I found soem stories to be too predictable.Although, trying to think of a suitable analogy, all I could come up with is something from Harry Potter...It's like Berty's All Flavoured Beans were turned into a Sci Fi animation series: Every episode has its own flavour and everyone will find at least one bean, I mean episode, that will capture their heart or imagination. But in there are just enough soap, slug and snot flavoured beans to make you think before chowing down.I can't put my finger on it, but I guess I loved the idea of the series more than the actual shows themselves.

The third episode was poorly animated, poorly acted, and bizarrely animated.Shallow, poorly acted, predictable, and overly interested in being edgy.\n",

Back then the technology of animation could not do justice to their adult and mostly sci fi stories. Now I think LD+R has found a new frontier. The age when you need human actors with their bloated egos and communist muttering is almost over. They know that and so they dump on this sort of thing. They say too violent and too heterosexual. I say bring it on! I have no trouble with animation beating the best Dinosaur Hollywood has to offer and it is happening. Now you can see anything you can imagine. Just one warning: don't become like the Krell or for that matter the Romans who both could have anything they wanted till it killed them.\n",
            "I feel like Netflix is trying really hard to be cool and forgets the ultimate goal of creating actual content. The show is not bad, but it doesnt feel original, I dont mean original as a plot but as a TV show category. Many new shows are really entertaining, like Umbrella Academy which was really fun, but they dont touch you like other shows did in the past. Its like they dont care anymore about the character development, but only about the catchy lines, the wanna-be dark humor/sarcasm, the \"coolness\" in general. I hope I am wrong.

I don't know what went wrong, but holy hell was it bad. It was like a collection of disguarded pixar shorts that just didn't make the cut. No compelling stories. No originality. What a tragedy.

            "\"Love, Death & Robots\" is both everything a series should strive to be, and many things it shouldn't. You get the sense that if the runtime of several episodes extended to even just 20 minutes, instead of 15 or sometimes 10, it could become one of the greatest shows of the last decade. The recent program \"Over the Garden Wall\" shared the same weakness. That show was a near-masterpiece, with a real sense of enchantment that is utterly lost in entertainment today. If each episode were but a few minutes longer there could have been a feeling of finality given to some of the stories. This show is the same way, with episodes like \"Fish Night\" and \"Alternate Histories\" as prime examples. The ideas themselves are inspired, beautifully captured on-screen and unique to themselves but often feel cut short. However, it's a credit to the series that the majority of episodes feel as ruminative and imaginative as they do with the little time they occupy. Close to be being a revelation, just not quite there. But an impressive and captivating work of art.\n",

            "In the early to mid 1990's, MTV was one of the few avenues in western society that someone could find visual media that went against the grain; not \"edgy\" so to speak (ok, SOME were way too edgy), but more hardcore and explicit than any other television network at the time. The internet was a niche form of technology at this time and, besides VHS Tape buying and trading, network and cable TV were the only way to watch visual media outside of movie theaters.Liquid Television was a half-hour block of short animations done by various artists that ran from 1991-1994. It was the breeding grounds for numerous shows that would go on to be cult classics such as Aeon Flux, The Head, and The Maxx. It was also where the first episode of Beavis and Butthead aired, a series that would become one of the most successful animated franchises of all time.As the 90's went on, numerous animated shows such as South Park, King of the Hill, and many others could trace their roots to the counter-culture animations, puppet shows, and other crazy shorts that graced American screens through Liquid Television. It wasn't all great though; I've gone back to watch some of these and think to myself \"How the hell did I or ANYONE find this amusing or funny when it came out?\". There was a good deal of crap to sift through to find some of the gems (Joe Normal still makes me laugh today).With the advent of broadband internet in the mid 2000's, YouTube provided an outlet that was tailored for the type of media on Liquid Television. I was surprised and excited to hear that Love, Death & Robots had a very Liquid Television feel to it and that a show like this was being made for the massive Netflix audience. I was also happy to hear that all of the shorts had the benefit of decent budgets in their creation. The Liquid Television shorts were usually done on a shoe-string budget and had a raw-animated style to them with many relying on their writing to get their point across.Love Death and Robots is amazing. It captures everything that made Liquid Television such a groundbreaking series. Zima Blue is one of the best written pieces of fiction I've ever seen.\n",

            "...but look at the CGI! Yeah, like a hot girlfriend with no personality. The novelty wears off and the visual appeal just underlines the disappointment of so much money being put through a millennial joke machine, so we, the dutifully self loathing masses can laugh in the right places. A laugh structure dependent on the punchline being a nihilistic, redemption free narrative, that we're supposed to already support, because we're part of the cool crowd.If you like laughs to be a catharsis that delivers a blow to a cruel world you are being subjected to, because you're an unimaginative, soulless, cynical waste of space, then look no further!No thanks.\n",
            "Really nothing new or that exciting here. Most of this has been done before and it's certainly not as well written or interesting as Black Mirror.Animations are great in some episodes and the voice acting can be good.Overall it's very average and forgettable.\n",
            "Not a hardcore anime fan but if I get a lot of recommendations, I am not averse to watching one. This one though has me yearning for more. New stories, awesome science fiction, adult themes, a lot of eye candy (and thats being very mild)...cant wait for more. Its that one gem out of ten crappy movies/shows Netflix is churning out these days.\n",
            "Ground breaking stylish animation undercut by simplistic, objectifying and sexist plotting. Half-baked. Saturated with jingoistic violence, gratuitous sex, nudity and nihilism. Rather tone deaf in its willingness to blindly celebrate these themes rather than examine them with any degree of intelligence. Characters are cartoonish in their motivations and responses, failing to react in a recognisably human (or intelligent) way to their situations but instead picking from a short list of tired stereotypes -- usually grunt, sex object or both. Disturbing, but only in the sense that you hoped removing inhibitions might lead to something fresh whereas it feels a lot more like a poorly developed male teen fantasy. The overall experience is like the old animated \"heavy metal\" movie which frankly today is just embarrassing to watch. Each episode feels like a long video game cut-scene with no skip button. A few interesting twists appear but they don't make up for the rest. Ultimately sterile and disappointing.\n",
            "An anthology of science fiction that range from comedy to thriller to sheer horror. These 18 animated shorts go from 7 to 17 minutes in length and are easy to binge. The animation of each of these stories varies in style. Some are photo realistic computers animation and others use classic 2D animation. Some of the tales ended too abruptly leaving the me wanting more. But I not sure if that's a bad thing. The only ones that fell out of place were Fish Night, The Witness which left me with more questions and The Dump whose ending wasn't much of a surprise. And were my only reason for not giving this a full 10 stars. Top of the class awards go to the titles Shape Shifters, Lucky 13, Three Robots, Sucker of Souls and Sonnie's Edge. The rest are very good I just like these better. These film shorts are NSFW and definitely not for children due to mature language, full nudity, sexual themes and graphic violence.\n",

Some absolutely stunning animation paired with some of the most, boring, uninspired writing and tacky voice acting I have ever witnessed. Every episode is a badly done rehash of an idea already presented better elsewhere. Nothing new, nothing groundbreaking, just a large animation budget. This is one of those shows where it's not good enough to enjoy and not bad enough to laugh at, pure mediocrity and a huge disappointment.\n",
            "..in this second series I was blown away by the sheer technical brilliance of the animation but really disappointed by the stories.

People with guns walking around shooting scary stuff type, and when they kill one bad guy--uh oh, another even badder guy pops up, and now they have to kill the boss for this new level.(One of the better stories of this type, I think, is Bad Traveling, which had a And Then there Were None arc which was nice)They're not all like this, I admit, there's some variety, but even then you have to put up with sci-fi cliches and the dialogue which is pretty crude and uninspired.I'm not sure why people seem to enjoy this as much as they do.\n",

            "For the most part, the stories in this anthology series are pretty simple. Many have been done before, and a handful do seem to share certain traits. The animation quality, while mostly different from short to short, is spectacular throughout. This show also isn't afraid of showing nudity or gore, which does turn some people away. If you have a weak stomach or you're looking for something more family-friendly, steer clear.The worst part about the series is how a lot of the stories just need more time. There were a handful that were fantastic, but would've been near-perfect if they'd had another twenty minutes or more to develop the characters and flesh out the stories. The short length also hurts the pacing for a few episodes, with everything moving so fast there's not enough time to really feel the atmosphere that the episode is going for. As a result, those episodes feel more like introductions to larger standalone series than one-off episodes in an anthology, and I'm not sure if that makes it better or worse.No matter what, though, this is a great show. Not perfect, but still a great time if you're looking for something different from the norm.\n",
            "Rather a sad collection of highly derivative stories.It has strongly fascistic, pro-war, pro-US imperialism themes.It seems, in many of the stories, to be propping up US exceptionalism.It is basically badly made, very obvious, immoral propaganda.\n",
            "I find I hate most anthologies because there just is not enough to hold one's interest for a full 40 minutes to an hour. The Twilight Zone was.25 minutes, and I think that is part of the reason I think for its success--it was not too long. There is normally only one thing of interest in most episodes and by the time it is done it has long exceeded my interest in the subject. At worse I only getting a little bored with some of these episodes, never downright bored and frustrated at the episode, just wanting the episode to end. So for me this format works so much better than any other recent anthology.Another interesting aspect is that many if not all of these episodes are fully animated, and it is amazing the level of animation that is possible today. Some it is obviously animation but sill amazing animation.\n",

            "Finally a new season has arrived.I must say that most of the episodes remind me of video games and they are fewer than before.I loved the scenarios of the episodes but in my opinion season 1 are far better than 2 and I missed a lot of the old robot characters*\n",
            "I honestly cannot believe how people are not aware that these are animations from a variety of studios, and that studios have been almost entirely remote during the pandemic; making organizing quite difficult.Season 2 was absolutely horrid on the story but I still find myself impressed with the graphical design...it make me question if other shows I was watching were just CGI and I had to snap back to reality.Every single episode (Season 2) felt cut short....which was disappointing for all the amazing effort, but perhaps if people recalled, that is because there is a pandemic.I sense season 3 will be a little closer to the story-rich quality of season 1 with actual endings and intentions of 'gotcha' finales.\n",
            "Probably one of the most overrated series of all time. The only positive trait of it is the animation, that explores a lot of styles and do this with uniquiness. But the stories are all empty, with no purpose if not to impress with it's imagery. The majority of them is so empty that don't even provoque feelings. Some episodes provoque it, but are so shallow and with nowhere to redirect it that makes it even worse. The pleasure of feeling with some scene is that we know the consequences for the story. But it's nothing what happens on this series: if someone dies here, thats what the show want us to see; if someone lives, idem. So the agony that I felt for the character is all gone sometimes even when the episode isn't even over - or for have understood this, the feeling doesn't even come up. This leave me with a lack that bothers me a lot: needing somewhere to put my feelings (an affection, a cheering, a wish, a willingness...). Some of the episodes provoque feelings and have a great background, with a nice message to the viewer, but these ones are the rarest and isolated cases. Even those ones with messages are also with a shallow lesson, needing a good development by the viewer to get to some nice thought. That's all can be said about Love, Death & Robots. A entire series with no purpose, no depth, without messages. And it's not a intrinsic characteristic of anthologies. Much more could be done, and it had so much potential to do it - but it looks like that they don't even try.\n",

Then came season 3 which is really just another bland wokist snore fest we've seen over and over and over again.

            "Fantasy monsters getting killed with big guns... If you find that interesting, then you are as shallow as these nonsense episodes with hardly any dialog, or deeper meaning, but just very good CGI. Video games have good CGI too, especially intros, and this show feels just like a bunch of pointless intros, a total waste of time, with lots of violent killing of monsters.Ofc with so many episodes, some very few are funny, like the rat problem at a farm, going over the top :)\n",

That included soldiers who were werewolves on both american and taliban side, in afghanistan. Yes, another showdown to death, as this is the main theme in this show, but this time with werewolves fighting each other to death, instead of alien like monsters...\n",

The medium was well done. The content was so vapid that a rating of 2 was hardly justifiable.\n",

            "I enjoyed the first season quite a bit. Beyond the Aquila Rift was probably the biggest standout for me, but almost all of the episodes were memorable, thought-provoking, captivating, or some combination of the three.By season two I was starting to get the sense that they were trying too hard to live up to the \"adult cartoon\" premise, with the superfluous gore or sex shoehorned into every episode often sticking out like a sore thumb.I didn't make it through season 3. The latest batch includes not one, but two episodes featuring oversized arthropods operating bloody human corpses like gastly meat puppets. Whatever those episodes actually had to say - which wasn't much, to be honest - was overshadowed by the garish spectacle. I doubt that I'll still remember their plots at all by this time next year.And to be honest, those were two of the better episodes of the season. Others were so paper-thin I've already forgotten what they were about - assuming they were about anything at all. But hey, it's a cartoon, only with blood and boobs and stuff. Cooooool, so edgy.\n",

You can't force a \"gritty\" tale. It either is or it isn't.Have something to say written by someone who has had some meaningful life experiences BEFORE you fire up the CGI engines.\n",

            "Even though the technical side of it all is surely \"topnoch\", the stories are mainly poor and repetitive: gratuitous violence and \"dejà vú\" aliens or fantasy creatures, all seasoned with some nudity here and there. It all has a flair of videogame animation that its certainly boring (apart from 3 or 4 episodes) and does not make any aproach to a more creative, crafty or contemporary animation or narrative which interpellates viewers to think and open their minds (and have fun doing so). I dont get how this is supposed to be meant for adult audiences with such lame scripts, really: Military Werewolves in Middle East?! (This particular one is embarassing..) Robot Monster Fights?! (Pokemon for adults I guess...) Farmers fighting aliens?! (Starship Troopers 2019)...creativity in pure state of downfall...\n",

The series is an overrated mediocrity that we are unfortunately used to.The animation is mostly very good, but the problem is the script as usual. When we watch a series or a movie, we want entertainment, without unnecessary things that only lower the overall impression and which ultimately turn us away from the series.Good animation is not enough to make the show interesting, and the usual clichés of \"modern\" film production, which have become so worn out that they have simply become boring and tiresome, do not help either.

After watching it I was intrigued to see more and was deeply disappointed.The other three episodes seemed like they were just looking for any excuse to cram as much violence, sex and ham-fisted political messages into the span of 30 minute episodes.I told my friend to turn it off after the good hunting episode. If this is what passes for \"amazing writing and art\" I guess I just don't understand.Writers, please use your brain and write something that is deeper then just violence, sex and your played out politics.\n",

            "More than have of the stories (so far, writing as of finishing Volume 3) we average or less, but there were a few gems in there. Also, all of the different art styles were amazing to see. A huge problem for me, however, was the volume of each of the episodes. Most of them were so quiet that I had to turn my tv up very high, but then on a dramatic part the episodes get so loud I have to lower it, drastically, then raise it again after the scene. I don't know if it's a Netflix issue or just my end but it really ruins it for me, especially since they're so short so I have to do it often. Also, on Netflix, the volumes are listed in opposite order (volume 3, 2, 1) and while the stories don't go together, I wanted to start at volume 1. It's easier if they're in order so I don't have to exit the show at the end of one volume to go to the next. That wasn't part of how I scored this, though. If there is going to be a volume 4, I may watch it, but if the volume thing is universal, please fix that. It highly ruins the experience.\n",
            "Let's start with the fact that there's less than half the number of episodes in the 2nd anthology; maybe COVID was a factor, maybe not, but going from 18 episodes in the 1st anthology to 8 in the second is disappointing, to say the least.Secondly, I didn't get the originality in the 2nd series that happened in the first. So many more kinds of animation, so many different tones to strike in the first; the second is really lame by comparison.Lastly - and let's be real here - nudity and sex was part of the novelty and appeal of the 1st go-around, and there's almost none in the second. It's like they didn't even try to out-do themselves the second time. Loved-loved-loved the first series, so very disappointed in the second. Take that for what you will.\n",
            "I am not a particular fan of anthology series. This is because they frustrate me in the fact that some of the episodes will be great, and some will be horrible or forgettable. This one has the same problem. Some of the episodes are great - for example the robot tourist episodes are funny, and the episode entitled bad sailing could be a feature length movie it's that good. There are a few other ones that are good, but I can't explain the premise of the story without giving away the story. But mostly that episodes either attempt to blow you away with great animation - although a lot of it does stray into the Uncanny Valley - or they try to shock you with some titillating or horrifying scene. It gets boring after a while. So I would suggest if you do check this out to find the best episodes and just watch those.\n",
            "Some ideas are really nice and some plots are exciting.But sadly a big part of the episodes have a childish comic look like pixar movies.
